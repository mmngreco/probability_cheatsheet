To find the probability that a CRV takes on a value in the interval $[a, b]$, subtract the respective CDFs.\[P(a \leq X \leq b) = P(X \leq b) - P(X \leq a) = F(b) - F(a)\]Note that for an r.v. with a normal distribution,\begin{align*}P(a\leq X\leq b)&=P(X\leq b)-P(X\leq a)\\&=\Phi \left(\frac{b-\mu }{\sigma ^2} \right) - \Phi \left( \frac{a-\mu }{\sigma ^2} \right)\end{align*}\item[What is the Cumulative Density Function (CDF)?] It is the following function of $x$.        \[F(x) = P(X \leq x)\]        % With the following properties. 1) $F$ is increasing. 2) $F$ is right-continuous. 3) $F(x) \rightarrow 1$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$, $F(x) \rightarrow 0$ as $x \rightarrow -\infty$\item[What is the Probability Density Function (PDF)?] The PDF, $f(x)$, is the derivative of the CDF. \[ F'(x) = f(x) \]Or alternatively,\[ F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t)dt \]Note that by the fundamental theorem of calculus,\[ F(b) - F(a) = \int^b_a f(x)dx \]Thus to find the probability that a CRV takes on a value in an interval, you can integrate the PDF, thus finding the area under the density curve.% Two additional properties of a PDF:  it must integrate to 1 (because the probability that a CRV falls in the interval $[-\infty, \infty]$ is 1, and the PDF must always be nonnegative.% \[\int^\infty_{-\infty}f(x)dx \hspace{2 cm} f(x) \geq 0\]\item[How do I find the expected value of a CRV?] Where in discrete cases you sum over the probabilities, in continuous cases you integrate over the densities.\[E(X) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}xf(x)dx \]% Review: Expected value is \emph{linear}. This means that for \emph{any} random variables $X$ and $Y$ and any constants $a, b, c$, the following is true:% \[E(aX + bY + c) = aE(X) + bE(Y) + c\]\end{description}\label{lotus}\subsection{Law of the Unconscious Statistician (LotUS)}\begin{description}\item[Expected Value of Function of RV]Normally, you would find the expected value of X this way:\[E(X) = \Sigma_x xP(X=x) \]\[E(X) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}xf(x)dx \]LotUS states that you can find the expected value of a \emph{function of a random variable} g(X) this way:\[E(g(X)) = \Sigma_x g(x)P(X=x) \]\[E(g(X)) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}g(x)f(x)dx \]\item[What's a function of a random variable?] A function of a random variable is also a random variable. For example, if $X$ is the number of bikes you see in an hour, then $g(X) =  2X$ could be the number of bike wheels you see in an hour. Both are random variables.\item[What's the point?] You don't need to know the PDF/PMF of $g(X)$ to find its expected value. All you need is the PDF/PMF of $X$. \end{description}\subsection{Universality of Uniform} When you plug any random variable into its own CDF, you get a Uniform[0,1] random variable. When you put a Uniform[0,1] into an inverse CDF, you get the corresponding random variable. For example, let's say that a random variable X has a CDF    \[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-x} \]    By the Universality of the the Uniform, if we plug in X into this function then we get a uniformly distributed random variable.    \[ F(X) = 1 - e^{-X} \sim U\]    Similarly, since $F(X) \sim U$ then $X \sim F^{-1}(U)$.

Specifically:    \begin{description}        \item[Mean] $E(X) = \mu'_1 $        \item[Variance] $\var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = \mu'_2 - (\mu_1')^2$        %\item[Skewness] $\mu_3 = Skew(X)$    \end{description}\subsection{Moment Generating Functions}\begin{description}    \item[MGF] For any random variable X, this expected value and function of dummy variable $t$;        \[ M_X(t) = E(e^{tX}) \]        is the \textbf{moment generating function (MGF)} of X if it exists for a finitely-sized interval centered around 0. Note that the MGF is just a function of a dummy variable $t$.    \item[Why is it called the Moment Generating Function?] Because the $k^{th}$ derivative of the moment generating function evaluated 0 is the $k^{th}$ moment of $X$!    \[\mu_k' = E(X^k) = M_X^{(k)}(0)\]    This is true by Taylor Expansion of $e^{tX}$    \[M_X(t) = E(e^{tX}) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{E(X^k)t^k}{k!} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\mu_k't^k}{k!} \]    Or by differentiation under the integral sign and then plugging in $t=0$    \begin{align*}        M_X^{(k)}(t) &= \frac{d^k}{dt^k}E(e^{tX}) = E\left(\frac{d^k}{dt^k}e^{tX}\right) = E(X^ke^{tX}) \\        M_X^{(k)}(0) &= E(X^ke^{0X}) = E(X^k) = \mu_k'    \end{align*}        \item[MGF of linear combinations] If we have $Y = aX + c$, then        \[M_Y(t) = E(e^{t(aX + c)}) =  e^{ct}E(e^{(at)X}) = e^{ct}M_X(at)\]                    \item[Uniqueness of the MGF.] \emph{If it exists, the MGF uniquely defines the distribution}. This means that for any two random variables $X$ and $Y$, they are distributed the same (their CDFs/PDFs are equal) if and only if their MGF's are equal. You can't have different PDFs when you have two random variables that have the same MGF.    \item[Summing Independent R.V.s by Multiplying MGFs.] If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then    \begin{align*}        M_{(X+Y)}(t) &= E(e^{t(X + Y)}) = E(e^{tX})E(e^{tY}) = M_X(t) \cdot M_Y(t) \\        M_{(X+Y)}(t) &= M_X(t) \cdot M_Y(t)    \end{align*}    The MGF of the sum of two random variables is the product of the MGFs of those two random variables.\end{description}\section{Joint PDFs and CDFs}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip\subsection{Joint Distributions}Review: Joint Probability of events $A$ and $B$: $P(A \cap B)$Both the Joint PMF and Joint PDF must be non-negative and sum/integrate to 1.

We see that the event $T_1 > t$, the event that you have to wait more than $t$ to get the first email, is the same as the event $N_t = 0$, which is the event that the number of emails in the first time interval of length $t$ is 0. We can solve for the distribution of $T_1$.\[P(T_1 > t) = P(N_t = 0) = e^{-\lambda t} \longrightarrow P(T_1 \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}\]Thus we have $T_1 \sim \Expo(\lambda)$.

The smallest value in a set of random variables will always vary and itself has a distribution. For any value of $X_{(i)}$, $X_{(i+1)} \geq X_{(j)}$.    \item[Distribution] - Taking $n$ i.i.d. random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots X_n$ with CDF $F(x)$ and PDF $f(x)$, the CDF and PDF of $X_{(i)}$ are as follows:    \[F_{X_{(i)}}(x) = P (X_{(j)} \leq x) = \sum_{k=i}^n {n \choose k} F(x)^k(1 - F(x))^{n - k}\]    \[f_{X_{(i)}}(x) = n{n - 1 \choose i - 1}F(x)^{i-1}(1 - F(X))^{n-i}f(x)\]    \item[Universality of the Uniform] - We can also express the distribution of the order statistics of $n$  i.i.d. random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots X_n$ in terms of the order statistics of $n$ uniforms.

The middle of three Uniforms is distributed $U_{(2)} \sim \Beta(2, 2)$, and the largest $U_{(3)} \sim \Beta(3, 1)$. The distribution of the the $j^{th}$ order statistic of $n$ i.i.d Uniforms is:    \begin{align*}        U_{(j)} &\sim \Beta(j, n - j + 1) \\        f_{U_{(j)}}(u) &= \frac{n!}{(j-1)!(n-j)!}t^{j-1}(1-t)^{n-j}    \end{align*}\end{description}\section{Conditional Expectation and Variance}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip\subsection{Conditional Expectation}\begin{description}    \item[Conditioning on an Event] - We can find the expected value of $Y$ given that event $A$ or $X=x$ has occurred.

Note the similarities between regularly finding expectation and finding the conditional expectation. The expected value of a dice roll given that it is prime is $\frac{1}{3}2 + \frac{1}{3}3 + \frac{1}{3}5 = 3\frac{1}{3}$. The expected amount of time that you have to wait until the shuttle comes (assuming that the waiting time is $\sim \Expo(\frac{1}{10})$) given that you have already waited $n$ minutes, is 10 more minutes by the memoryless property.\end{description}        \scalebox{0.85}{            \begin{tabular}{ccc}            \toprule                  \textbf{Discrete Y} & \textbf{Continuous Y} \\            \midrule            $E(Y) = \sum_y yP(Y=y)$ & $E(Y) =\int_{-\infty}^\infty yf_Y(y)dy$ \\            $E(Y|X=x) = \sum_y yP(Y=y|X=x)$ & $E(Y|X=x) =\int_{-\infty}^\infty yf_{Y|X}(y|x)dy$ \\            $E(Y|A) = \sum_y yP(Y=y|A)$ & $E(Y|A) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty yf(y|A)dy$ \\             \bottomrule            \end{tabular}        }\begin{description}    \item[Conditioning on a Random Variable] - We can also find the expected value of $Y$ given the random variable $X$.

We can use the central limit theorem when we have a random variable, $Y$ that is a sum of $n$ i.i.d. random variables with $n$ large. Let us say that $E(Y) = \mu_Y$ and $\var(Y) = \sigma^2_Y$. We have that:\[Y \dot{\,\sim\,} \N(\mu_Y, \sigma^2_Y)\]When we use central limit theorem to estimate $Y$, we usually have $Y = X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n$ or $Y = \bar{X}_n= \frac{1}{n}(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n)$. Specifically, if we say that each of the iid $X_i$ have mean $\mu_X$ and $\sigma^2_X$, then we have the following approximations.\[ X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n \dot{\,\sim\,} \N(n\mu_X, n\sigma^2_X) \]\[ \bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n}(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n) \dot{\,\sim\,} \N(\mu_X, \frac{\sigma^2_X}{n}) \]\subsubsection{Asymptotic Distributions using CLT}We use $\xrightarrow{d}$ to denote \emph{converges in distribution to} as $n \longrightarrow \infty$.

We let $X_t$ denote which element of the state space the walk is on at time $t$. The Markov Chain is the set of random variables denoting where the walk is at all points in time, $\{X_0, X_1, X_2, \dots \}$, as long as if you want to predict where the chain is at at a future time, you only need to use the present state, and not any past information. In other words, the \emph{given the present, the future and past are conditionally independent}. Formal Definition:\[P(X_{n+1} = j | X_0 = i_0, X_1 = i_1, \dots, X_n = i) = P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i)\]\subsection{State Properties}A state is either recurrent or transient.\begin{itemize}\item If you start at a \textbf{Recurrent State}, then you will always return back to that state at some point in the future.  \textmusicalnote \emph{You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave.}  \textmusicalnote\item Otherwise you are at a \textbf{Transient State}. There is some probability that once you leave you will never return. \textmusicalnote \emph{You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.} \textmusicalnote\end{itemize}A state is either periodic or aperiodic.\begin{itemize}\item If you start at a \textbf{Periodic State} of period $k$, then the GCD of all of the possible number steps it would take to return back is  $> 1$.\item Otherwise you are at an \textbf{Aperiodic State.} The GCD of all of the possible number of steps it would take to return back is 1.\end{itemize}\subsection{Transition Matrix}Element $q_{ij}$ in square transition matrix Q is the probability that the chain goes from state $i$ to state $j$, or more formally:\[q_{ij} = P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i)\]To find the probability that the chain goes from state $i$ to state $j$ in $m$ steps, take the $(i, j)^\textnormal{th}$ element of $Q^m$.\[q^{(m)}_{ij} = P(X_{n+m} = j | X_n = i)\]If $X_0$ is distributed according to row-vector PMF $\vec{p}$ (e.g. $p_j = P(X_0 = i_j)$), then the PMF of $X_n$ is $\vec{p}Q^n$.\subsection{Chain Properties}A chain is \textbf{irreducible} if you can get from anywhere to anywhere. An irreducible chain must have all of its states recurrent. A chain is \textbf{periodic} if any of its states are periodic, and is \textbf{aperiodic} if none of its states are periodic. In an irreducible chain, all states have the same period. \\A chain is \textbf{reversible} with respect to $\vec{s}$ if $s_iq_{ij} = s_jq_{ji}$ for all $i, j$.  A reversible chain running on $\vec{s}$ is indistinguishable whether it is running forwards in time or backwards in time. Examples of reversible chains include random walks on undirected networks, or any chain with $q_{ij} = q_{ji}$, where the Markov chain would be stationary with respect to $\vec{s} = (\frac{1}{M}, \frac{1}{M}, \dots, \frac{1}{M})$. \\\textbf{Reversibility Condition Implies Stationarity} - If you have a PMF $\vec{s}$ on a Markov chain with transition matrix $Q$, then $s_iq_{ij} = s_jq_{ji}$ for all $i, j$ implies that $s$ is stationary.\subsection{Stationary Distribution}Let us say that the vector $\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_M)$ is a possible and valid PMF of where the Markov Chain is at at a certain time. We will call this vector the stationary distribution, $\vec{s}$, if it satisfies $\vec{s}Q = \vec{s}$. As a consequence, if $X_t$ has the stationary distribution, then all future $X_{t+1}, X_{t + 2}, \dots$ also has the stationary distribution. \\For irreducible, aperiodic chains, the stationary distribution exists, is unique, and $s_i$ is the long-run probability of a chain being at state $i$. The expected number of steps to return back to $i$ starting from $i$ is $1/s_i$ To solve for the stationary distribution, you can solve for $(Q' - I)(\vec{s})' = 0$. The stationary distribution is uniform if the columns of $Q$ sum to 1.\subsection{Random Walk on Undirected Network}If you have a certain number of nodes with edges between them, and a chain can pick any edge randomly and move to another node, then this is a random walk on an undirected network. The stationary distribution of this chain is proportional to the $\textbf{degree sequence}.$ The \textbf{degree sequence} is the vector of the degrees of each node, defined as how many edges it has.\section{Continuous Distributions}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip\subsection{Uniform} Let us say that $U$ is distributed $\Unif(a, b)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Properties of the Uniform] For a uniform distribution, the probability of an draw from any interval on the uniform is proportion to the length of the uniform. The PDF of a Uniform is just a constant, so when you integrate over the PDF, you will get an area proportional to the length of the interval.    \item[Example] William throws darts really badly, so his darts are uniform over the whole room because they're equally likely to appear anywhere. William's darts have a uniform distribution on the surface of the room. The uniform is the only distribution where the probably of hitting in any specific region is proportion to the area/length/volume of that region, and where the density of occurrence in any one specific spot is constant throughout the whole support.%     \item[PDF and CDF (top is Unif(0, 1), bottom is Unif(a, b))]  % \begin{eqnarray*}% %\Unif(0, 1)%   %\hspace{.7 in}%    f(x) = \left\{%      \begin{array}{lr}%        1 & x \in [0, 1] \\%        0 &  x \notin [0, 1]%      \end{array}%    \right.%    %\hspace{.95 in}%    F(x) = \left\{%      \begin{array}{lr}%        0 & x < 0 \\%        x & x \in [0, 1] \\%        1 &  x > 1%      \end{array}%    \right.\\% %\Unif(a, b)%   %\hspace{.65 in}%    f(x) = \left\{%      \begin{array}{lr}%        \frac{1}{b-a} & x \in [a, b] \\%        0 &  x \notin [a, b]%      \end{array}%    \right.%    %\hspace{.75 in}%    F(x) = \left\{%      \begin{array}{lr}%        0 & x < a \\%        \frac{x-a}{b-a} & x \in [a, b] \\%        1 &  x > b%      \end{array}%    \right. % \end{eqnarray*}    \end{description}\subsection{Normal} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Central Limit Theorem] The Normal distribution is ubiquitous because of the central limit theorem, which states that averages of independent identically-distributed variables will approach a normal distribution regardless of the initial distribution.    \item[Transformable] Every time we stretch or scale the normal distribution, we change it to another normal distribution. If we add $c$ to a normally distributed random variable, then its mean increases additively by $c$. If we multiply a normally distributed random variable by $c$, then its variance increases multiplicatively by $c^2$. Note that for every normally distributed random variable $X \sim \N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we can transform it to the standard $\N(0, 1)$ by the following transformation:    \[\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \sim \N(0, 1) \]    \item[Example] Heights are normal. Measurement error is normal. By the central limit theorem, the sampling average from a population is also normal.    \item[Standard Normal] - The Standard Normal, denoted $Z$, is $Z \sim \N(0, 1)$%     \item[PDF]% \[ f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \]    \item[CDF] - It's too difficult to write this one out, so we express it as the function $\Phi(x)$\end{description}\subsection{Exponential Distribution}Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Expo(\lambda)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] You're sitting on an open meadow right before the break of dawn, wishing that airplanes in the night sky were shooting stars, because you could really use a wish right now. You know that shooting stars come on average every 15 minutes, but it's never true that a shooting star is ever `'due" to come because you've waited so long. Your waiting time is memorylessness, which means that the time until the next shooting star comes does not depend on how long you've waited already.        \item[Example] The waiting time until the next shooting star is distributed $\Expo(4)$. The 4 here is $\lambda$, or the rate parameter, or how many shooting stars we expect to see in a unit of time. The expected time until the next shooting star is $\frac{1}{\lambda}$, or $\frac{1}{4}$ of an hour. You can expect to wait 15 minutes until the next shooting star.        \item[Expos are rescaled Expos]        \[Y \sim \Expo(\lambda) \rightarrow X = \lambda Y \sim \Expo(1)\]     %     \item[PDF and CDF] The PDF and CDF of a Exponential is:% \[f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, x \in [0, \infty)\]% \[F(x) = P(X \leq x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}, x \in [0, \infty)\]        \item[Memorylessness] The Exponential Distribution is the sole continuous memoryless distribution. This means that it's always ``as good as new", which means that the probability of it failing in the next infinitesimal time period is the same as any infinitesimal time period. This means that for an exponentially distributed $X$ and any real numbers $t$ and $s$,    \[P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t)\]    Given that you've waited already at least $s$ minutes, the probability of having to wait an additional $t$ minutes is the same as the probability that you have to wait more than $t$ minutes to begin with. Here's another formulation.    \[X - a | X > a \sim \Expo(\lambda)\]    Example - If waiting for the bus is distributed exponentially with $\lambda = 6$, no matter how long you've waited so far, the expected additional waiting time until the bus arrives is always $\frac{1}{6}$, or 10 minutes. The distribution of time from now to the arrival is always the same, no matter how long you've waited.    \item[Min of Expos] If we have independent $X_i \sim \Expo(\lambda_i)$, then $\min(X_1, \dots, X_k) \sim \Expo(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \dots + \lambda_k)$.     \item[Max of Expos] If we have i.i.d. $X_i \sim \Expo(\lambda)$, then $\max(X_1, \dots, X_k) \sim \Expo(k\lambda) + \Expo((k-1)\lambda) + \dots + \Expo(\lambda)$    \end{description}\subsection{Gamma Distribution}Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Gam(a, \lambda)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] You sit waiting for shooting stars, and you know that the waiting time for a star is distributed $\Expo(\lambda)$. You want to see ``$a$" shooting stars before you go home. $X$ is the total waiting time for the $a$th shooting star.    \item[Example]  You are at a bank, and there are 3 people ahead of you. The serving time for each person is distributed Exponentially with mean of 2 time units. The distribution of your waiting time until you begin service is $\Gam(3, \frac{1}{2})$%     \item[PDF] The PDF of a Gamma is:% \begin{eqnarray*}% f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(a)}(\lambda x)^ae^{-\lambda x}\frac{1}{x},% \hspace{.1 in}% x \in [0, \infty)% \end{eqnarray*}    % \item[Properties and Representations]\end{description}\subsection{Beta Distribution}\begin{description}\item[Conjugate Prior of the Binomial] A prior is the distribution of a parameter before you observe any data ($f(x)$). A posterior is the distribution of a parameter after you observe data $y$ ($f(x|y)$). Beta is the \emph{conjugate} prior of the Binomial because if you have a Beta-distributed prior on $p$ (the parameter of the Binomial), then the posterior distribution on $p$ given observed data is also Beta-distributed. This means, that in a two-level model:    \begin{align*}        X|p &\sim \Bin(n, p) \\        p &\sim \Beta(a, b)    \end{align*}Then after observing the value $X = x$, we get a posterior distribution $p|(X=x) \sim \Beta(a + x, b + n - x)$\item[Order statistics of the Uniform] See \emph{Order Statistics}\item[Relationship with Gamma] This is the bank-post office result.

We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] A Chi-Squared(n) is a sum of $n$ independent squared normals.    \item[Example]  The sum of squared errors are distributed $\chi^2_n$%     \item[PDF] The PDF of a $\chi^2_1$ is:% \begin{eqnarray*}% f(w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi w}}e^{-w/2},% w \in [0, \infty)% \end{eqnarray*}    \item[Properties and Representations]\end{description}\[E(\chi^2_n) = n, Var(X) = 2n, \chi_n^2 \sim \Gam\left(\frac{n}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\]\[\chi_n^2 = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + \dots + Z_n^2, Z \sim^{i.i.d.} \N(0, 1)\]\section{Discrete Distributions} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskipDWR = Draw w/ replacement, DWoR = Draw w/o replacement\begin{center}    \begin{tabular}{ccc}    \toprule    ~ & \textbf{DWR} & \textbf{DWoR}  \\    \midrule        \textbf{Fixed \# trials (n)} & Binom/Bern & HGeom \\         ~ & (Bern if $n = 1$) & ~ \\         \textbf{Draw 'til $k$ success} & NBin/Geom & NHGeom \\         ~ & (Geom if $k = 1$) & (see example probs) \\ \bottomrule    \end{tabular}\end{center}\subsection{Bernoulli} The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest case of the Binomial distribution, where we only have one trial, or $n=1$. Let us say that X is distributed \Bern($p$). We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story.] $X$ ``succeeds" (is 1) with probability $p$, and $X$ ``fails" (is 0) with probability $1-p$.    \item[Example.] A fair coin flip is distributed \Bern($\frac{1}{2}$).%     \item[PMF.] The probability mass function of a Bernoulli is:% \[P(X = x) = p^x(1-p)^{1-x}\]% or simply% \[P(X = x) = \begin{cases} p, & x = 1 \\ 1-p, & x = 0 \end{cases}\]\end{description}\subsection{Binomial} Let us say that $X$ is distributed \Bin($n,p$). We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] $X$ is the number of "successes" that we will achieve in $n$ independent trials, where each trial can be either a success or a failure, each with the same probability $p$ of success. We can also say that $X$ is a sum of multiple independent $Bern(p)$ random variables. Let $X \sim \Bin(n, p)$ and $X_j \sim \Bern(p)$, where all of the Bernoullis are independent. We can express the following:    \[X = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \dots + X_n\]    \item[Example] If Jeremy Lin makes 10 free throws and each one independently has a $\frac{3}{4}$ chance of getting in, then the number of free throws he makes is distributed  \Bin($10,\frac{3}{4}$), or, letting X be the number of free throws that he makes, X is a Binomial Random Variable distributed  \Bin($10,\frac{3}{4}$).%     \item[PMF] The probability mass function of a Binomial is:% \[P(X = x) = {n  \choose x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\]    \item[Binomial Coefficient] ${n  \choose k}$ is a function of $n$ and $k$ and is read \emph{n choose k}, and means out of $n$ possible indistinguishable objects, how many ways can I possibly choose $k$ of them? The formula for the binomial coefficient is:\[{n  \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\]\end{description}\subsection{Geometric} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Geom(p)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] $X$ is the number of ``failures" that we will achieve before we achieve our first success. Our successes have probability $p$.    \item[Example] If each pokeball we throw has a $\frac{1}{10}$ probability to catch Mew, the number of failed pokeballs will be distributed $\Geom(\frac{1}{10})$.%     \item[PMF] With $q = 1-p$, the probability mass function of a Geometric is:% \[P(X = k) = q^kp\]\end{description}\subsection{First Success} Equivalent to the geometric distribution, except it counts the total number of ``draws" until the first success. This is 1 more than the number of failures. If $X \sim FS(p)$ then $E(X) = 1/p$.\subsection{Negative Binomial} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\NBin(r, p)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] $X$ is the number of ``failures" that we will achieve before we achieve our $r$th success. Our successes have probability $p$.    \item[Example] Thundershock has 60\% accuracy and can faint a wild Raticate in 3 hits. The number of misses before Pikachu faints Raticate with Thundershock is distributed $\NBin(3, .6)$.%     \item[PMF] With $q = 1-p$, the probability mass function of a Negative Binomial is:% \[P(X = n) = {n+r - 1 \choose r -1}p^rq^n\]\end{description}\subsection{Hypergeometric} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Hypergeometric(w, b, n)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] In a population of $b$ undesired objects and $w$ desired objects, $X$ is the number of ``successes" we will have in a draw of $n$ objects, without replacement.    \item[Example] 1) Let's say that we have only $b$ Weedles (failure) and $w$ Pikachus (success) in Viridian Forest. We encounter $n$ Pokemon in the forest, and $X$ is the number of Pikachus in our encounters. 2) The number of aces that you draw in 5 cards (without replacement). 3) You have $w$ white balls and $b$ black balls, and you draw $n$ balls. You will draw $X$ white balls. 4) Elk Problem - You have $N$ elk, you capture $n$ of them, tag them, and release them. Then you recollect a new sample of size $m$. How many tagged elk are now in the new sample?    \item[PMF] The probability mass function of a Hypergeometric:\[P(X = k) = \frac{{w \choose k}{b \choose n-k}}{{w + b \choose n}}\]\end{description}\subsection{Poisson} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Pois(\lambda)$. We know the following:\begin{description}    \item[Story] There are rare events (low probability events) that occur many different ways (high possibilities of occurences) at an average rate of $\lambda$ occurrences per unit space or time. The number of events that occur in that unit of space or time is $X$.        \item[Example] A certain busy intersection has an average of 2 accidents per month. Since an accident is a low probability event that can happen many different ways, the number of accidents in a month at that intersection is distributed $\Pois(2)$. The number of accidents that happen in two months at that intersection is distributed $\Pois(4)$    %     \item[PMF] The PMF of a Poisson is:% \[P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!}\]\end{description}\section{Multivariate Distributions} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip\subsection{Multinomial}    Let us say that the vector $\vec{\textbf{X}} = (X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots, X_k) \sim \textnormal{Mult}_k(n, \vec{p})$  where $\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k)$.\begin{description}    \item[Story] - We have $n$ items, and then can fall into any one of the $k$ buckets independently with the probabilities $\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k)$.    \item[Example] - Let us assume that every year, 100 students in the Harry Potter Universe are randomly and independently sorted into one of four houses with equal probability. The number of people in each of the houses is distributed $\Mult_4$(100, $\vec{p}$), where $\vec{p} = (.25, .25, .25, .25)$.        Note that $X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_4 = 100$, and they are dependent.    \item[Multinomial Coefficient] The number of permutations of $n$ objects where you have $n_1, n_2, n_3 \dots, n_k$ of each of the different variants is the \textbf{multinomial coefficient}.        \[{n \choose n_1n_2\dots n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_k!}\]    \item[Joint PMF] - For $n = n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_k$        \[P(\vec{X} = \vec{n}) = {n \choose n_1n_2\dots n_k}p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\dots p_k^{n_k}\]    \item[Lumping] - If you lump together multiple categories in a multinomial, then it is still multinomial. A multinomial with two dimensions (success, failure) is a binomial distribution.    \item[Variances and Covariances] - For $(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k) \sim \Mult_k(n, (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k))$, we have that marginally $X_i \sim \Bin(n, p_i)$ and hence $\var(X_i) = np_i(1-p_i)$. Also, for $i\neq j$, $\cov(X_i, X_j) = -np_ip_j$, which is a result from class.    \item[Marginal PMF and Lumping]        \[X_i \sim \Bin(n, p_i)\]        \[X_i + X_j \sim \Bin(n, p_i + p_j)\]\end{description}        \[\mathsmaller{\mathsmaller{X_1, X_2, X_3 \sim \Mult_3(n, (p_1, p_2, p_3)) \rightarrow X_1, X_2 + X_3 \sim \Mult_2(n, (p_1, p_2 + p_3))}}\]        \[X_1, \dots, X_{k-1} | X_k = n_k \sim \Mult_{k-1}\left(n - n_k, \left(\frac{p_1}{1 - p_k}, \dots, \frac{p_{k-1}}{1 - p_k}\right)\right)\]\subsection{Multivariate Uniform}See the univariate uniform for stories and examples. For multivariate uniforms, all you need to know is that probability is proportional to volume. More formally, probability is the volume of the region of interest divided by the total volume of the support. Every point in the support has equal density of value $\frac{1}{\textnormal{Total Area}}$.\subsection{Multivariate Normal (MVN)}A vector $\vec{X} = (X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots, X_k)$ is declared Multivariate Normal if any linear combination is normally distributed (e.g. $t_1X_1 + t_2X_2 + \dots + t_kX_k$ is Normal for any constants $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k$). The parameters of the Multivariate normal are the mean vector $\vec{\mu} = (\mu_1, \mu_2, \dots, \mu_k)$ and the covariance matrix where the $(i, j)^{\textnormal{th}}$ entry is $\cov(X_i, X_j)$. For any MVN distribution: 1) Any sub-vector is also MVN. 2) If any two elements of a multivariate normal distribution are uncorrelated, then they are independent. Note that 2) does not apply to most random variables. \section{Distribution Properties} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip\subsection{Important CDFs}\begin{description}    \item[Exponential] $F(X) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}, x \in (0, \infty)$)    \item[Uniform(0, 1)] $F(X) = x, x \in (0, 1)$\end{description}\subsection{Poisson Properties (Chicken and Egg Results)}We have $X \sim \Pois(\lambda_1)$ and $Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_2)$ and $X \independent Y$.\begin{enumerate}    \item $X + Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)$    \item $X | (X + Y = k) \sim \Bin\left(k, \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}\right)$    \item If we have that $Z \sim \Pois(\lambda)$, and we randomly and independently ``accept" every item in $Z$ with probability $p$, then the number of accepted items $Z_1 \sim \Pois(\lambda p)$, and the number of rejected items $Z_2 \sim \Pois(\lambda q)$, and $Z_1 \independent Z_2$.\end{enumerate}\subsection{Convolutions of Random Variables}A convolution of $n$ random variables is simply their sum.\begin{enumerate}    \item  $X \sim \Pois(\lambda_1)$, $Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_2)$, $X \independent Y \longrightarrow X + Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)$    \item  $X \sim \Bin(n_1, p)$, $Y \sim \Bin(n_2, p)$, $X \independent Y \longrightarrow X + Y \sim \Bin(n_1 + n_2, p)$ Note that Binomial can thus be thought of as a sum of iid Bernoullis.    \item  $X \sim \Gam(n_1, \lambda)$, $Y \sim \Gam(n_2, \lambda)$, $X \independent Y \longrightarrow  X + Y \sim\Gam(n_1 + n_2, \lambda)$ Note that Gamma can thus be thought of as a sum of iid Expos.    \item  $X \sim \NBin(r_1, p)$, $Y \sim \NBin(r_2, p)$, $X \independent Y \longrightarrow  X + Y \sim\NBin(r_1 + r_2, p)$    \item All of the above are approximately normal when $\lambda, n, r$ are large by the Central Limit Theorem.    \item  $Z_1 \sim \N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)$, $Z_2 \sim \N(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)$, $Z_1 \independent Z_2 \longrightarrow  Z_1 + Z_2 \sim \N(\mu_1 + \mu_2, \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2)$\end{enumerate}\subsection{Special Cases of Random Variables}\begin{enumerate}    \item $\Bin(1, p) \sim \Bern(p)$    \item $\Beta(1, 1) \sim \Unif(0, 1)$    \item $\Gam(1, \lambda) \sim \Expo(\lambda)$    \item $\chi^2_n \sim \Gam\left(\frac{n}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$    \item $\NBin(1, p) \sim \Geom(p)$\end{enumerate}\subsection{Reasoning by Representation}\begin{description}    \item[Beta-Gamma relationship] If $X \sim \Gam(a, \lambda)$, $Y \sim \Gam(b, \lambda)$, $X \independent Y$ then    \begin{itemize}    	\item $\frac{X}{X + Y} \sim \Beta(a, b)$    	\item $X + Y \independent \frac{X}{X + Y}$    \end{itemize}    This is also known as the \textbf{bank-post office result}.    \item[Binomial-Poisson Relationship] $\Bin(n, p) \rightarrow \Pois(\lambda)$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, $p \rightarrow 0$, $np = \lambda$.    \item[Order Statistics of Uniform] $U_{(j)} \sim \Beta(j, n - j + 1)$    \item[Universality of Uniform] For any $X$ with CDF $F(x)$, $F(X) \sim U$\end{description}\section{Formulas} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskipIn general, remember that PDFs integrated (and PMFs summed) over support equal 1.\subsection{Geometric Series}\[ a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a\frac{1 - r^n}{1 -r} \]\subsection{Exponential Function ($e^x$)}\[ e^x = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}= 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left( 1 + \frac{x}{n} \right)^n \]\subsection{Gamma and Beta Distributions}You can sometimes solve complicated-looking integrals by pattern-matching to the following:\[ \int_0^\infty x^{t-1}e^{-x}\, dx = \Gamma(t) \hspace{1 cm} \int_0^1 x^{a - 1}(1-x)^{b-1}\, dx = \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a + b)} \]Where $\Gamma(n) = (n - 1)!$ if $n$ is a positive integer\subsection{Bayes' Billiards (special case of Beta)}\[ \small \int_0^1 x^k(1 - x)^{n-k} \, dx = \frac{1}{(n+1){n \choose k}} \] %\hskip .5cm \int_0^1 \frac{\Gamma(a + b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)} x^{a - 1} (1-x)^{b-1} \, dx = 1  \]\subsection{Euler's Approximation for Harmonic Sums}\[ 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{n} \approx \log n + 0.57721\dots\]\subsection{Stirling's Approximation}\[ n! \sim \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n\]\section{Miscellaneous Definitions} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip\begin{description}\item[Medians] A continuous random variable $X$ has median $m$ if$P(X \leq m) = 50\%$ \\A discrete random variable $X$ has median $m$ if$P(X \leq m) \geq 50\% \textnormal{ and } P(X \geq m) \geq 50\%$\item[Log] Statisticians generally use $\log$ to refer to $\ln$\item[i.i.d random variables] Independent, identically-distributed random variables.\end{description}\section{Example Problems} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskipContributions from Sebastian Chiu\subsection{Calculating Probability (1)}A textbook has $n$ typos, which are randomly scattered amongst its $n$ pages. You pick a random page, what is the probability that it has no typos? \textbf{Answer - } There is a $\left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)$ probability that any specific typo isn't on your page, and thus a $\left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n$ probability that there are no typos on your page. For $n$ large, this is approximately $e^{-1} = \boxed{1/e}$ by a definition of $e^x$.\subsection{Calculating Probability (2)} In a group of $n$ people, what is the expected number of distinct birthdays (month and day). What is the expected number of birthday matches? \textbf{Answer -} Let $X$ be the number of distinct birthdays, and let $I_j$ be the indicator for whether the $j^{th}$ days is represented. \[E(I_j) = 1-P(\textnormal{no one born day }j) = 1 - \left(364/365\right)^n\] By linearity, $\boxed{E(X) = 365\left(1-(364/365\right)^n)}$. Now let $Y$ be the number of birthday matches and let $J_i$ be the indicator that the $i^{th}$ pair of people have the same birthday. The probability that any two people share a birthday is $1/365$ so $\boxed{E(Y) = \binom{n}{2} / 365}$. \subsection{Linearity of Expectation}\emph{This problem is commonly known as the \textbf{hat-matching problem}}.$n$ people have $n$ hats each. At the end of the party, they each leave with a random hat. What is the expected number of people that leave with the right hat? \textbf{Answer - } Each hat has a $1/n$ chance of going to the right person. By linearity of expectation, the average number of hats that go to their owners is $\boxed{n(1/n) = 1}$.\subsection{First Success and Linearity of Expectation}\emph{This problem is commonly known as the \textbf{coupon collector problem}}.There are $n$ total coupons, and each draw, you get a random coupon. What is the expected number of coupons needed until you have a complete set? \textbf{Answer - } Let $N$ be the number of coupons needed; we want $E(N)$. Let $N = N_1 + \dots + N_n$, $N_1$ is the draws to draw our first distinct coupon, $N_2$ is the \emph{additional} draws needed to draw our second distinct coupon and so on. By the story of First Success, $N_2 \sim FS((n-1)/n)$ (after collecting first coupon type, there's $(n-1)/n$ chance you'll get something new). Similarly, $N_3 \sim FS((n-2)/n)$, and $N_j \sim FS((n-j+1)/n)$. By linearity,\[E(N) = E(N_1) + \dots + E(N_n) = \frac{n}{n} + \frac{n}{n-1} + \dots + \frac{n}{1} = \boxed{n\sum^n_{j=1} \frac{1}{j}}\]Which is approximately $n \log(n)$ by Euler's approximation for harmonic sums.\subsection{First Step Conditioning} In every time period, Bobo the amoeba can die, live, or split into two amoebas with probabilities $0.25$, $0.25$, and $0.5$, respectively. All of Bobo's offspring have the same probabilities. Find $P(D)$, the probability that Bobo's lineage eventually dies out. \textbf{Answer - } We use law of probability, and define the events $B_0$, $B_1$. and $B_2$ where $B_i$ means that Bobo has split into $i$ amoebas. We note that $P(D | B_0) = 1$ since his lineage has died, $P(D | B_1) = P(D)$, and $P(D | B_2) = P(D)^2$ since  both lines of his lineage must die out in order for Bobo's lineage to die out.\begin{align*}P(D) &= 0.25P(D|B_0) + 0.25 P(D|B_1) + 0.5 P(D|B_2)\\&= 0.25 + 0.25P(D) + 0.5P(D)^2\end{align*}Solving the quadratic equation, we get that $P(D) = 0.5 \textnormal{ or } 1$. We dismiss $1$ as an extraneous solution since the expected number of Bobos increase every generation. Thus our answer is $\boxed{P(D) = 0.5}$\subsection{Orderings of i.i.d. random variables}I call 2 UberX's and 3 Lyfts at the same time. If the time it takes for the rides to reach me is i.i.d., what is the probability that all the Lyfts will arrive first? \textbf{Answer - } since the arrival times of the five cars are i.i.d., all $5!$ orderings of the arrivals are equally likely. There are $3!2!$ orderings that involve the Lyfts arriving first, so the probability that the Lyfts arrive first is $\boxed{\frac{3!2!}{5!} = 1/10}$. Alternatively, there are ${5 \choose 3}$ ways to choose 3 of the 5 slots for the Lyfts to occupy, where each of the choices are equally likely. 1 of those choices have all 3 of the Lyfts arriving first, thus the probability is $\boxed{1 / {5 \choose 3} = 1/10}$\subsection{Expectation of Negative Hypergeometric}What is the expected number of cards that you draw before you pick your first Ace in a shuffled deck?\textbf{Answer -} Consider a non-Ace. Denote this to be card $j$. Let $I_j$ be the indicator that card $j$ will be drawn before the first Ace. Note that if $j$ is before all 4 of the Aces in the deck, then $I_j = 1$. The probability that this occurs is $1/5$, because out of 5 cards (the 4 Aces and the not Ace), the probability that the not Ace comes first is $1/5$. $1/5$ here is the probability that any specific non-Ace will appear before all of the Aces in the deck. (e.g. the probability that the Jack of Spades appears before all of the Aces). Thus let $X$ be the number of cards that is drawn before the first Ace. Then $X = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_{48}$, where each indicator correspond to one of the 48 not Aces. Thus, \[E(X) = E(I_1) + E(I_2) + ... + E(I_{48}) = 48/5 = \boxed{9.6}\].\subsection{Minimum and Maximum of Random Variables}What is the CDF of the maximum of $n$ independent Uniformly-distributed random variables? \textbf{Answer - } Note that \[ P(\min(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) \geq a) = P(X_1 \geq a, X_2 \geq a, \dots, X_n \geq a) \] Similarily, \[ P(\max(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) \leq a) = P(X_1 \leq a, X_2 \leq a, \dots, X_n \leq a) \] We will use that principal to find the CDF of $U_{(n)}$, where $U_{(n)} = \max(U_1, U_2, \dots, U_n)$ where $U_i \sim \Unif(0, 1)$ (iid). \begin{align*} P(\max(U_1, U_2, \dots, U_n) \leq a)&= P(U_1 \leq a, U_2 \leq a, \dots, U_n \leq a) \\&= P(U_1 \leq a)P(U_2 \leq a)\dots P(U_n \leq a) \\&= \boxed{a^n}\end{align*}\subsection{Pattern Matching with $e^x$ Taylor Series}For $X \sim \Pois(\lambda)$, find $\displaystyle E\bigg{(}\frac{1}{X+1}\bigg{)}$. \textbf{Answer - } By LOTUS,\[E\left(\frac{1}{X+1}\right) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k+1} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!} = \frac{e^{-\lambda}}{\lambda}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} = \boxed{\frac{e^{-\lambda}}{\lambda}(e^\lambda-1)}\]\subsection{Adam and Eve's Laws}William really likes speedsolving Rubik's Cubes. But he's pretty bad at it, so sometimes he fails. On any given day, William will attempt $N \sim \Geom(s)$ Rubik's Cubes. Suppose each time, he has a independent probability $p$ of solving the cube. Let $T$ be the number of Rubik's Cubes he solves during a day. Find the mean and variance of $T$. \textbf{Answer - } Note that $T|N \sim \Bin(N,p)$. As a result, we have by Adam's Law that \[E(T) = E(E(T|N)) = E(Np) = \boxed{\displaystyle\frac {p (1-s)}{s}}\] Similarly, by Eve's Law, we have that \begin{align*}    \var(T) &= E(\var(T|N)) + \var(E(T|N)) =  E(Np(1-p)) + \var(Np)\\&= \frac{p(1-p)(1-s)}{s} +  \frac{p^2(1-s)}{s^2} = \boxed{\frac{p(1-s)(p+s(1-p))}{s^2}}    \end{align*}\subsection{MGF - Distribution Matching}(Referring to the Rubik's Cube question above) Find the MGF of $T$. What is the name of this distribution and its parameter(s)? \textbf{Answer - }    By Adam's Law, we have that \begin{align*} E(e^{tT}) &= E(E(e^{tT}|N)) =E((pe^t + q)^N) = s\sum_{n=0}^\infty(pe^t + 1-p)^n(1-s)^n \\&=\frac{s}{1-(1-s)(pe^t+1-p)} =\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p-(1-s)pe^t}    \end{align*}        Intuitively, we would expect that $T$ is distributed Geometrically because $T$ is just a filtered version of $N$, which itself is Geometrically distributed. The MGF of a Geometric random variable $X\sim\Geom(\theta)$ is \[E(e^{tX}) = \displaystyle\frac{\theta}{1-(1-\theta) e^t}\]        So, we would want to try to get our MGF into this form to identify what $\theta$ is. Taking our original MGF, it would appear that dividing by $s+(1-s)p$ would allow us to do this. Therefore, we have that \begin{center}    $E(e^{tT}) = \displaystyle\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p - (1-s)pe^t} = \frac{\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p}}{1-\frac{(1-s)p}{s+(1-s)p}e^t}$    \end{center}        By pattern-matching, it thus follows that $\boxed{T \sim \Geom(\theta)}$ where \[\boxed{\theta = \displaystyle\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p}}\]\subsection{MGF - Finding Momemts}Find $E(X^3)$ for $X \sim \Expo(\lambda)$ using the MGF of $X$. \textbf{Answer - } The MGF of an $\Expo(\lambda)$ is $M(t) = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda-t}$. To get the third moment, we can take the third derivative of the MGF and evaluate at $t=0$: \[\boxed{E(X^3) = \frac{6}{\lambda^3}}\]But a much nicer way to use the MGF here is via pattern recognition: note that $M(t)$ looks like it came from a geometric series:\[\frac{1}{1-\frac{t}{\lambda}} = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \left(\frac{t}{\lambda}\right)^n = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{n!}{\lambda^n} \frac{t^n}{n!}\] The coefficient of $\frac{t^n}{n!}$ here is the $n^{th}$ moment of $X$, so we have $E(X^n) = \frac{n!}{\lambda^n}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. So again we get the same answer.\subsection{Markov Chains}Suppose $X_n$ is a two-state Markov chain with transition matrix \[Q = \bordermatrix{~ & 0 & 1 \cr                  0 & 1-\alpha & \alpha \cr                  1 & \beta & 1-\beta \cr}\] Find the stationary distribution $\vec{s} = (s_0, s_1)$ of $X_n$ by solving $\vec{s} Q = \vec{s}$, and show that the chain is reversible under this stationary distribution. \textbf{Answer - } By solving $\vec{s}Q = \vec{s}$, we have that \[s_0 = s_0(1-\alpha) + s_1 \beta \textnormal{ and } s_1 = s_0(\alpha) + s_0(1-\beta)\] And by solving this system of linear equations it follows that \[\boxed{\vec{s} = \displaystyle\bigg{(}\frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta}, \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\bigg{)}}\] To show that this chain is reversible under this stationary distribution, we must show $s_i q_{ij} = s_j q_{ji}$ for all $i, j$. This is done if we can show $s_0 q_{01} = s_1 q_{10}$. Indeed, \[s_0  q_{01}  = \frac{\alpha\beta}{\alpha+\beta} = s_1 q_{10}\] thus our chain is reversible under the stationary distribution.\subsection{Markov Chains, continued}William and Sebastian play a modified game of Settlers of Catan, where every turn they randomly move the robber (which starts on the center tile) to one of the adjacent hexagons.% hex grid code modified from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/61429/how-to-draw-a-hexagonal-grid-with-numbers-in-the-cells\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture} [hexa/.style= {shape=regular polygon,regular polygon sides=6,minimum size=1cm, draw,inner sep=0,anchor=south,rotate=30}]\foreach \j in {0,...,2}{%\pgfmathsetmacro\end{2+\j}   \foreach \i in {0,...,\end}{%  \node[hexa] (h\i;\j) at ({(\i-\j/2)*sin(60)},{\j*0.75}) {};}  }      \node [circle,minimum size=1cm] at (h2;2) {Robber};\foreach \j in {0,...,1}{%  \pgfmathsetmacro\end{3-\j}   \foreach \i in {0,...,\end}{%  \pgfmathtruncatemacro\k{\j+2}    \node[hexa] (h\i;\k) at ({(\i+\j/2-0.5)*sin(60)},{2.25+\j*0.75}) {};}  } \end{tikzpicture}\end{center}\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]    \item Is this Markov Chain irreducible? Is it aperiodic? \textbf{Answer - } $\boxed{\textnormal{Yes to both}}$ The Markov Chain is irreducible because it can get from anywhere to anywhere else. The Markov Chain is also aperiodic because the robber can return back to a square in $2, 3, 4, 5, \dots$ moves. Those numbers have a GCD of 1, so the chain is aperiodic.    \item What is the stationary distribution of this Markov Chain? \textbf{Answer - }Since this is a random walk on an undirected graph, the stationary distribution is proportional to the degree sequence. The degree for the corner pieces is 3, the degree for the edge pieces is 4, and the degree for the center pieces is 6. To normalize this degree sequence, we divide by its sum. The sum of the degrees is $6(3) + 6(4) + 7(6) = 84$. Thus the stationary probability of being on a corner is $3/84 = 1/28$, on an edge is $4/84 =  1/21$, and in the center is $6/84 = 1/14$.    \item What fraction of the time will the robber be in the center tile in this game? \textbf{Answer - } From above, $\boxed{1/14}$.    \item What is the expected amount of moves it will take for the robber to return? \textbf{Answer - } Since this chain is irreducible and aperiodic, to get the expected time to return we can just invert the stationary probability. Thus on average it will take $\boxed{14}$ turns for the robber to return to the center tile.\end{enumerate}\section{Problem Solving Strategies} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskipContributions from Jessy Hwang, Yuan Jiang, Yuqi Hou\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -.25em\item \textbf{Getting Started.} Start by \emph{defining events} and/or \emph{defining random variables}. (''Let $A$ be the event that I pick the fair coin''; ``Let $X$ be the number of successes.'') Clear notion = clear thinking! Then decide what it is that you're supposed to be finding, in terms of your location (``I want to find $P(X=3|A)$''). Try simple and extreme cases. To make an abstract experiment more concrete, try drawing a picture or making up numbers that could have happened. Pattern recognition: does the structure of the problem resemble something we've seen before.\item \textbf{Calculating Probability of an Event.} Use combinatorics if the naive definition of probability applies. Look for symmetries or something to condition on, then apply Bayes' rule or LoTP. Is the probability of the complement easier to find?\item \textbf{Finding the distribution of a random variable.} Check the \emph{support} of the random variable: what values can it take on? Use this to rule out distributions that don't fit. - Is there a \emph{story} for one of the named distributions that fits the problem at hand? - Can you write the random variable as a function of a r.v. with a known distribution, say $Y = g(X)$? Then work directly from the definition of PDF or PMF, expressing $P(Y \leq y)$ or $P(Y = y)$ in terms of events involving $X$ only. - For PDFs, find the CDF first and then differentiate. - If you're trying to find the joint distribution of two \emph{independent} random variables, just multiple their marginal probabilities - Do you need the distribution? If the question only asks for the expected value of $X$, you might be able to find this without knowing the entire distirbution of $X$. See the next item.\item \textbf{Calculating Expectation.} If it has a named distribution, check out the table of distributions. If its a function of a r.v. with a named distribution, try LotUS. If its a count of something, try breaking it up into indicator random variables. If you can condition on something, consider using Adam's law. Also consider the variance formula.\item \textbf{Calculating Variance.} Consider independence, named distributions, and LotUS. If it's a count of something, break it up into a sum of indicator random variables. If you can condition on something, consider using Eve's Law.\item \textbf{Calculating $E(X^2)$} - Do you already know $E(X)$ or $\var(X)$? Remember that $\var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2$.\item \textbf{Calculating Covariance} If it's a count of something, break it up into a sum of indicator random variables. If you're trying to calculate the covariance between two components of a multinomial distribution, $X_i, X_j$, then the covariance is $-np_ip_j$.\item If $X$ and $Y$ are i.i.d., have you considered using symmetry? \item \textbf{Calculating Probabilities of Orderings of Random Variables} Have you considered looking at order statistics? - Remember any ordering of i.i.d. random variables is equally likely.\item Is this the birthday problem? Is this a multinomial problem?\item \textbf{Determining Independence} Use the definition of independence. Think of extreme cases to see if you can find a counterexample.\item Does something look like Simpson's Paradox? make sure you're looking at 3 events. \item \textbf{Find the PDF.} If the question gives you two r.v., where you know the PDF of one r.v. and the other r.v. is a function of the first one, then the problem wants you to use a transformation of variables (Jacobian). You can also find the pdf by differentiating the CDF.\item \textbf{Do a painful integral.} If your integral looks painful, see if you can write your integral in terms of a PDF (like Gamma or Beta), so that the integral equals 1.\item \textbf{Before moving on.} Plug in some simple and extreme cases to make sure that your answer makes sense.\end{enumerate}\section{Biohazards} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskipSection author: Jessy Hwang\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -.25em\item \textbf{Don't misuse the native definition of probability}  - When answering ``What is the probability that in a group of 3 people, no two have the same birth month?'', it is \emph{not} correct to treat the people as indistinguishable balls being placed into 12 boxes, since that assumes the list of birth months \{January, January, January\} is just as likely as the list \{January, April, June\}, when the latter is fix times more likely.\item \textbf{Don't confuse unconditional and conditional probabilities, or go in circles with Baye's Rule} - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$. It is \emph{not} correct to say ``$P(B) = 1$ because we know that $B$ happened.''; P(B) is the probability \emph{before} we have information about whether \emph{B} happened. It is \emph{not} correct to use $P(A|B)$ in place of $P(A)$ on the right-hand side.\item \textbf{Don't assume independence without justification} - In the matching problem, the probability that card 1 is a match and card 2 is a match is not $1/n^2$. - The Binomial and Hypergeometric are often confused; the trials are independent in the Binomial story and not independent in the Hypergeometric story due to the lack of replacement.\item \textbf{Don't confuse random variables, numbers, and events.} - Let $X$ be a r.v. Then $f(X)$ is a r.b. for any function $f$. In particular, $X^2$, $|X|$, $F(X)$, and $I_{X>3}$ are r.v.s. $P(X^2 < X | X \geq 0), E(X), \var(X), $ and $f(E(X))$ are numbers. $X = 2$ and $F(X) \geq -1$ are events. It does not make sense to write $\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(X) dx$ because $F(X)$ is a random variable. It does not make sense to write $P(X)$ because $X$ is not an event.\item \textbf{A random variable is not the same thing as its distribution} - To get the PDF of $X^2$, you can't just square the PDF of $X$. The right way is to use \hyperref[one variable transformations]{one variable transformations} - To get the PDF of $X + Y$, you can't just add the PDF of $X$ and the PDF of $Y$. The right way is to compute the \hyperref[convolutions]{convolution}.\item \textbf{$E(g(X))$ does not equal $g(E(X))$ in general.} - See the St. Petersburg paradox for an extreme example. - The right way to find $E(g(X))$ is with \hyperref[lotus]{LotUS}.\end{enumerate}\section{Recommended Resources} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip\begin{itemize} \itemsep -.25em\item Introduction to Probability (\url{http://bit.ly/introprobability})\item Stat 110 Online (\url{http://stat110.net})\item Stat 110 Quora Blog (\url{https://stat110.quora.com/})\item Stat 110 Course Notes (\texttt{\href{http://www.mxawng.com/stuff/notes/stat110.pdf}{mxawng.com/stuff/notes/stat110.pdf}})\item Quora Probability FAQ (\url{http://bit.ly/probabilityfaq})\item LaTeX File (\texttt{\href{https://github.com/wzchen/probability_cheatsheet}{github.com/wzchen/probability\_cheatsheet}})\end{itemize}\begin{center}\emph{Please share this cheatsheet with friends!} \url{http://wzchen.com/probability-cheatsheet}\end{center}\end{multicols}\begin{center}\section{Distributions}\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}\begin{tabular}{cccccc}\textbf{Distribution} & \textbf{PDF and Support} & \textbf{Expected Value}  & \textbf{Variance} & \textbf{MGF}\\\hline \hline\shortstack{Bernoulli \\ \Bern($p$)} & \shortstack{$P(X=1) = p$ \\$ P(X=0) = q$} & $p$ & $pq$ & $q + pe^t$ \\\hline\shortstack{Binomial \\ \Bin($n, p$)} & \shortstack{$P(X=k) = {n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$  \\ $k \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots n\}$}& $np$ & $npq$ & $(q + pe^t)^n$ \\\hline\shortstack{Geometric \\ \Geom($p$)} & \shortstack{$P(X=k) = q^kp$  \\ $k \in \{$0, 1, 2, \dots $\}$}& $q/p$ & $q/p^2$ & $\frac{p}{1-qe^t}, qe^t < 1$\\\hline\shortstack{Negative Binom. \\ \NBin($r, p$)} & \shortstack{$P(X=n) = {r + n - 1 \choose r -1}p^rq^n$ \\ $n \in \{$0, 1, 2, \dots $\}$} & $rq/p$ & $rq/p^2$ &  $(\frac{p}{1-qe^t})^r, qe^t < 1$\\\hline\shortstack{Hypergeometric \\ \Hypergeometric($w, b, n$)} & \shortstack{$P(X=k) = \sfrac{{w \choose k}{b \choose n-k}}{{w + b \choose n}}$ \\ $k \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots,  n\}$} & $\mu = \frac{nw}{b+w}$ &$\frac{w+b-n}{w+b-1}n\frac{\mu}{n}(1 - \frac{\mu}{n})$& $-$  \\\hline\shortstack{Poisson \\ \Pois($\lambda$)} & \shortstack{$P(X=k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!}$ \\ $k \in \{$0, 1, 2, \dots $\}$} & $\lambda$ & $\lambda$ & $e^{\lambda(e^t-1)}$ \\\hline\hline\shortstack{Uniform \\ \Unif($a, b$)} & \shortstack{$ f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$ \\$ x \in (a, b) $} & $\frac{a+b}{2}$ & $\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$ &  $\frac{e^{tb}-e^{ta}}{t(b-a)}$\\\hline\shortstack{Normal \\ $\N(\mu, \sigma^2)$} & \shortstack{$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\sfrac{(x - \mu)^2}{(2 \sigma^2)}}$ \\ $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$} & $\mu$  & $\sigma^2$ & $e^{t\mu + \frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}}$\\\hline\shortstack{Exponential \\ $\Expo(\lambda)$} & \shortstack{$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$\\$ x \in (0, \infty)$} & $\sfrac{1}{\lambda}$  & $\sfrac{1}{\lambda^2}$ & $\frac{\lambda}{\lambda - t}, t < \lambda$\\\hline\shortstack{Gamma \\ $\Gam(a, \lambda)$} & \shortstack{$f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(a)}(\lambda x)^ae^{-\lambda x}\frac{1}{x}$\\$ x \in (0, \infty)$} & $\sfrac{a}{\lambda}$  & $\sfrac{a}{\lambda^2}$ & $\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda - t}\right)^a, t < \lambda$\\\hline\shortstack{Beta \\ \Beta(a, b)} & \shortstack{$f(x) = \frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1}$\\$x \in (0, 1) $} & $\mu = \frac{a}{a + b}$  & $\frac{\mu(1-\mu)}{(a + b + 1)}$ & $-$\\\hline\shortstack{Chi-Squared \\ $\chi_n^2$} & \shortstack{$\frac{1}{2^{n/2}\Gamma(n/2)}x^{n/2 - 1}e^{-x/2}$\\$x \in (0, \infty) $} & $n$  & $2n$ & $(1 - 2t)^{-n/2}, t < 1/2$\\\hline\hline\shortstack{Multivar Uniform \\ A is support} & \shortstack{$f(x) = \frac{1}{|A|}$\\$  x \in A $} & $-$  & $-$ & $-$\\\hline\shortstack{Multinomial \\ \Mult$_k(n, \vec{p}$)} & \shortstack{$P(\vec{X} = \vec{n}) = {n \choose n_1\dots n_k}p_1^{n_1}\dots p_k^{n_k}$ \\ $n = n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_k$} & $n\vec{p}$ & \shortstack{$\var(X_i) = np_i(1-p_i)$ \\ $\cov(X_i, X_j) = -np_ip_j$} & $\left(\sum_{i=1}^k p_ie^{t_i}\right)^n$ \\\hline\hline\end{tabular}\hskip 1cm\section{Inequalities}\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}% Tighter\begin{tabular}{cccc}\textbf{Cauchy-Schwarz} & \textbf{Markov} & \textbf{Chebychev} & \textbf{Jensen} \\ $|E(XY)| \leq \sqrt{E(X^2)E(Y^2)}$ & $\displaystyle P(X \geq a) \leq \frac{E|X|}{a}$ &$\displaystyle P(|X - \mu_X| \geq a) \leq \frac{\sigma^2_X}{a^2}$ &$g$ convex: $E(g(X)) \geq g(E(X))$ \\ [0ex]&&& $g$ concave: $E(g(X)) \leq g(E(X))$ \\ \end{tabular}\end{center}\end{document}

% \subsection{Set Theory}

% \begin{description}
%     \item[Sets and Subsets] - A set is a collection of distinct objects. $A$ is a subset of $B$ if every element of $A$ is also included in $B$.
%     \item[Empty Set] - The empty set, denoted $\emptyset$, is the set that contains nothing.
%     \item[Set Notation] - Note that ${\bf {\bf A}} \cup {\bf B}$, ${\bf A} \cap {\bf B}$, and ${\bf A^c}$ are all sets too.
%     \begin{description}
%         \item[Union] - ${\bf A} \cup {\bf B}$ (read \emph{{\bf A} union {\bf B}}) means ${\bf A}\ or\ {\bf B}$
%         \item[Intersection] - ${\bf A} \cap {\bf B}$ (read \emph{{\bf A} intersect {\bf B}}) means ${\bf A}\ and \ {\bf B}$
%         \item[Complement] - ${\bf A^c}$ (read \emph{{\bf A} complement}) occurs whenever ${\bf A}$ does not occur
%     \end{description}
%     \item[Disjoint Sets] - Two sets are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set (e.g. they don't overlap).
%     \item[Partition] - A set of subsets ${\bf A}_1, {\bf A}_2, {\bf A}_3, ... {\bf A}_n$ partition a space if they are disjoint and cover all possible outcomes (e.g. their union is the entire set). A simple case of a partitioning set of subsets is ${\bf A}, {\bf A^c}$
%         \item[Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion] - Helps you find the probabilities of unions of events. 
%         \[ P ({\bf A} \cup {\bf B}) = P({\bf A}) + P({\bf B}) - P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B}) \]
%         \[P(\textnormal{Union of many events}) = \textnormal{Singles} - \textnormal{Doubles} + \textnormal{Triples} - \textnormal{Quadruples} \dots\]

 Let's say we have a compound experiment (an experiment with multiple components). If the 1st component has $n_1$ possible outcomes, the 2nd component has $n_2$ possible outcomes, \dots, and the $r$th component has $n_r$ possible outcomes, then overall there are $n_1n_2 \dots n_r$ possibilities for the whole experiment.

    The sampling table gives the number of possible samples of size $k$ out of a population of size $n$, under various assumptions about how the sample is collected.

    % \item[Experiments/Outcomes] - An experiment generates an outcome from a pre-determined list. For example, a dice roll generates outcomes in the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
    % \item[Sample Space] - The sample space, denoted $\Omega$, is the set of possible outcomes. Note that the probability of this event is 1, since something in the sample space will always occur.
    % \item[Event] - An event is a subset of the sample space, or a collection of possible outcomes of an experiment. We say that the event has occurred if any of the outcomes in the event have happened.
    \subsection{Naive Definition of Probability}  {If all outcomes are equally likely}, the probability of an event $A$ happening is:
        \[P_{\textrm{naive}}(A) = \frac{\textnormal{number of outcomes favorable to $A$}}{\textnormal{number of outcomes}}\]

\section{Thinking Conditionally} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

% \subsection{Set Theory and Statistics}
% %To understand probability it helps to understand basic set theory. An \emph{event} is a set in that it is a collection of possible outcomes of an experiment (or a subset of the sample space). With set theory we can talk about things like unions, intersections, or complements of events.

% \begin{description}
%     \item[Experiments/Outcomes] - An experiment generates an outcome from a pre-determined list. For example, a dice roll generates outcomes in the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
%     \item[Sample Space] - The sample space, denoted $\Omega$, is the set of possible outcomes. Note that the probability of this event is 1, since something in the sample space will always occur.
%     \item[Event] - An event is a subset of the sample space, or a collection of possible outcomes of an experiment. We say that the event has occurred if any of the outcomes in the event have happened.
% \end{description}

%\subsection{Disjointness Versus Independence}
\subsection{Independence}

    \begin{description}
        % \item[Disjoint Events] - ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$ are disjoint when they cannot happen simultaneously, or
        %   \begin{align*}
        %     P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B}) &= 0\\
        %     {\bf A} \cap {\bf B} &= \emptyset
        %   \end{align*}
        \item[Independent Events] $A$ and $B$ are independent if knowing whether $A$ occurred gives no information about whether $B$ occurred. More formally, $A$ and $B$ (which have nonzero probability) are independent if and only if one of the following equivalent statements holds: 
           \begin{align*} 
            P({A}\cap { B}) &= P({A})P({B}) \\
            P({ A}|{ B}) &= P({A})\\
            P(B|A) &= P(B)
           \end{align*}
        \item[Conditional Independence]  ${A}$ and ${B}$ are conditionally independent given ${C}$ if $P({A}\cap {B}|{C}) = P({A}|{C})P({B}|{C})$. Conditional independence does not imply independence, and independence does not imply conditional independence.
    \end{description}
    
\subsection{Unions, Intersections, and Complements}

    \begin{description}

        \item[De Morgan's Laws] A useful identity that can make calculating probabilities of unions easier by relating them to intersections, and vice versa. Analogous results hold with more than two sets.
           \begin{align*} 
        ({A} \cup { B})^c = {A^c} \cap { B^c} \\
        ({A} \cap {B})^c = { A^c} \cup { B^c}
           \end{align*} 
                  
        % \item[Complements] - The following are true.
        %    \begin{align*} 
        %      {\bf A} \cup {\bf A}^c &= \Omega \\
        %      {\bf A} \cap {\bf A}^c &= \emptyset\\
        %      P({\bf A}) &= 1 -  P({\bf A}^c)
        %    \end{align*} 

    \end{description}

\subsection{Joint, Marginal, and Conditional}

    \begin{description}
        \item[Joint Probability] $P({A} \cap {B}) $ or $P({ A}, {B})$ -- Probability of ${ A}$ and ${B}$.
        \item[Marginal (Unconditional) Probability] $P({A})$ -- Probability of ${A}$.
        \item[Conditional Probability]  $P({A}|{B}) = P(A,B)/P(B)$ -- Probability of ${A}$, given that ${B}$ occurred.
        \item[Conditional Probability \emph{is} Probability]  $P({A}|{ B})$ is a probability function for any fixed $B$. Any theorem that holds for probability also holds for conditional probability.
    %     \item[Bayes' Rule] - Bayes' Rule unites marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities. We use this as the definition of conditional probability.
    % \[P({\bf A}|{\bf B}) = \frac{P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B})}{P({\bf B})} = \frac{P({\bf B}|{\bf A})P({\bf A})}{P({\bf B})}\]
    \end{description}

\subsection{Probability of an Intersection or Union}
\textbf{Intersections via Conditioning}
\begin{align*} 
    P(A,B) &= P(A)P(B|A) \\
   P(A,B,C) &= P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A,B) 
   \end{align*}
   \textbf{Unions via Inclusion-Exclusion}
   \begin{align*} 
    P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\
  P(A \cup B \cup C) &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) \\
&\quad - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) \\
&\quad + P(A \cap B \cap C).
   \end{align*}


\subsection{Simpson's Paradox}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/SimpsonsParadox.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
 It is possible to have
\[P(A\mid B,C) < P(A\mid B^c, C) \textnormal{ and } P(A\mid B, C^c) < P(A \mid B^c, C^c)\]
\[ \textnormal{yet also } P(A\mid B) > P(A \mid B^c).\]
    
\subsection{Law of Total Probability (LOTP)}
Let ${ B}_1, { B}_2, { B}_3, ... { B}_n$ be a \emph{partition} of the sample space (i.e., they are disjoint and their union is the entire sample space).
\begin{align*} 
    P({ A}) &= P({ A} | { B}_1)P({ B}_1) + P({ A} | { B}_2)P({ B}_2) + \dots + P({ A} | { B}_n)P({ B}_n)\\
    P({ A}) &= P({ A} \cap { B}_1)+ P({ A} \cap { B}_2)+ \dots + P({ A} \cap { B}_n)
    \end{align*} 
    For \textbf{LOTP with extra conditioning}, just add in another event $C$!
    \begin{align*} 
    P({ A}| { C}) &= P({ A} | { B}_1, { C})P({ B}_1 | { C}) + \dots +  P({ A} | { B}_n, { C})P({ B}_n | { C})\\
    P({ A}| { C}) &= P({ A} \cap { B}_1 | { C})+ P({ A} \cap { B}_2 | { C})+ \dots +  P({ A} \cap { B}_n | { C})
\end{align*} 

Special case of LOTP with ${ B}$ and ${ B^c}$ as partition:
   \begin{align*} 
P({ A}) &= P({ A} | { B})P({ B}) + P({ A} | { B^c})P({ B^c}) \\
P({ A}) &= P({ A} \cap { B})+ P({ A} \cap { B^c}) \\
   \end{align*} 
   
\subsection{Bayes' Rule}

\textbf{Bayes' Rule, and with extra conditioning (just add in $C$!)}
         \[P({ A}|{ B})  = \frac{P({ B}|{ A})P({ A})}{P({ B})}\]
         \[P({ A}|{ B}, { C}) = \frac{P({ B}|{ A}, { C})P({ A} | { C})}{P({ B} | { C})}\]
         We can also write
         $$P(A|B,C) = \frac{P(A,B,C)}{P(B,C)} = \frac{P(B,C|A)P(A)}{P(B,C)}$$
\textbf{Odds Form of Bayes' Rule}
\[\frac{P({ A}| { B})}{P({ A^c}| { B})} = \frac{P({ B}|{ A})}{P({ B}| { A^c})}\frac{P({ A})}{P({ A^c})}\]
The \emph{posterior odds} of $A$ are the \emph{likelihood ratio} times the \emph{prior odds}.

% Law of Total Probability with ${\bf B}$ and ${\bf B^c}$ (special case of a partitioning set), and with Extra Conditioning (just add C!)
%    \begin{align*} 
% P({\bf A}) &= P({\bf A} | {\bf B})P({\bf B}) + P({\bf A} | {\bf B^c})P({\bf B^c}) \\
% P({\bf A}) &= P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B})+ P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B^c}) \\

% P({\bf A} | {\bf C}) &= P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B} | {\bf C})+ P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B^c} | {\bf C})
%    \end{align*} 
   
% Law of Total Probability with a partitioning ${\bf B}_0, {\bf B}_1, {\bf B}_2, {\bf B}_3, \dots, {\bf B}_n$, and applied to random variables ${\bf X}$, ${\bf Y}$.
% \begin{align*}

% P({\bf Y}=y) &= \sum_{k}P({\bf Y}=y|{\bf X}=k)P({\bf X}=k)
%    \end{align*} 
% Bayes' Rule, and with Extra Conditioning (just add C!)
%     \begin{align*}
%          P({\bf A}|{\bf B}) &= \frac{P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B})}{P({\bf B})} = \frac{P({\bf B}|{\bf A})P({\bf A})}{P({\bf B})} \\
%          P({\bf A}|{\bf B}, {\bf C}) &= \frac{P({\bf A} \cap {\bf B} | {\bf C})}{P({\bf B} | {\bf C})} = \frac{P({\bf B}|{\bf A}, {\bf C})P({\bf A} | {\bf C})}{P({\bf B} | {\bf C})} 
%     \end{align*}
    
\subsection{PMF, CDF, and Independence}
\begin{description}

\item[Probability Mass Function (PMF)] 
Gives the probability that a \emph{discrete} random variable takes on the value $x$.
\[ p_X(x) = P(X=x) \]
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/Binpmf.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
The PMF satisfies
\[p_X(x) \geq 0 \textrm{ and } \sum_x p_X(x) = 1 \]


\item[Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)] 
Gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to $x$.
\[F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)\]
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/Bincdf.pdf}
        \end{minipage}

The CDF is an increasing, right-continuous function with
\[F_X(x) \to 0 \textrm{ as $x \to -\infty$ and } F_X(x) \to 1 \textrm{ as $x \to \infty$} \]
\item[Independence] Intuitively, two random variables are independent if knowing the value of one gives  no information about the other. Discrete r.v.s $X$ and $Y$ are independent if for \emph{all} values of $x$ and $y$  \begin{center}
$P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y)$
\end{center}

\end{description}

\section{Expected Value and Indicators}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip


\subsection{Expected Value and Linearity}
\begin{description}
\item[Expected Value] (a.k.a.~\emph{mean}, \emph{expectation}, or \emph{average}) is a weighted average of the possible outcomes of our random variable. Mathematically, if $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots$ are all of the distinct possible values that $X$ can take, the expected value of $X$ is
\begin{center}
$E(X) = \sum\limits_{i}x_iP(X=x_i)$
\end{center}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/linearity.pdf}
        \end{minipage}


\item[Linearity] For any r.v.s $X$ and $Y$, and constants $a,b,c,$ 
\[E(aX + bY + c) = aE(X) + bE(Y) + c \]

\item[Same distribution implies same mean] If $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution, then $E(X)=E(Y)$ and, more generally, 
$$E(g(X)) = E(g(Y))$$


\item[Conditional Expected Value] is defined like expectation, only conditioned on any event $A$. \begin{center}
$\ E(X | A) = \sum\limits_{x}xP(X=x | A)$
\end{center}

\end{description}

\subsection{Indicator Random Variables}
\begin{description}
\item[Indicator Random Variable] is a random variable that takes on the value 1 or 0. It is always an indicator of some event: if the event occurs, the indicator is 1; otherwise it is 0. They are useful for many problems about counting how many events of some kind occur. Write \[
I_A =
 \begin{cases}
   1 & \text{if $A$ occurs,} \\
   0 & \text{if $A$ does not occur.}
  \end{cases}
\]
Note that $I_A^2 = I_A, I_A I_B = I_{A \cap B}, $ and $I_{A \cup B} = I_A + I_B - I_A I_B$. 
\item[Distribution] $I_A \sim \Bern(p)$ where $p = P(A)$.
\item[Fundamental Bridge] The expectation of the indicator for event $A$ is the probability of event $A$: $E(I_A) = P(A)$. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Variance and Standard Deviation}
\[\var(X) = E \left(X - E(X)\right)^2 = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2\]
\[\textrm{SD}(X) = \sqrt{\var(X)}\]


\section{Continuous RVs, LOTUS,  UoU}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

\subsection{Continuous Random Variables (CRVs)}
\begin{description}
% \item[What is a Continuous Random Variable (CRV)?] A continuous random variable can take on any possible value within a certain interval (for example, [0, 1]), whereas a discrete random variable can only take on variables in a list of countable values (for example, all the integers, or the values 1, $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}$, etc.)
% \item[Do Continuous Random Variables have PMFs?] No. The probability that a continuous random variable takes on any specific value is 0.
\item[What's the probability that a CRV is in an interval?] Take the difference in CDF values (or use the PDF as described later).
\[P(a \leq X \leq b) = P(X \leq b) - P(X \leq a) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)\]

For $X \sim \N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, this becomes
\begin{align*}
P(a\leq X\leq b)&=\Phi \left(\frac{b-\mu }{\sigma } \right) - \Phi \left( \frac{a-\mu }{\sigma } \right)
\end{align*}

\item[What is the Probability Density Function (PDF)?] The PDF $f$ is the derivative of the CDF $F$.
\[ F'(x) = f(x) \]
A PDF is nonnegative and integrates to $1$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, to get from PDF back to CDF we can integrate:
\begin{align*} 
    F(x) &=  \int_{-\infty}^x f(t)dt  
   \end{align*}
   \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/Logisticpdfcdf.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
   To find the probability that a CRV takes on a value in an interval, integrate the PDF over that interval.
      \begin{align*} 
    F(b) - F(a)  &=  \int^b_a f(x)dx
       \end{align*}
   


% Two additional properties of a PDF:  it must integrate to 1 (because the probability that a CRV falls in the interval $[-\infty, \infty]$ is 1, and the PDF must always be nonnegative.
% \[\int^\infty_{-\infty}f(x)dx \hspace{2 cm} f(x) \geq 0\]
\item[How do I find the expected value of a CRV?] Analogous to the discrete case, where you sum $x$ times the PMF, for CRVs you integrate $x$ times the PDF.
\[E(X) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}xf(x)dx \]
% Review: Expected value is \emph{linear}. This means that for \emph{any} random variables $X$ and $Y$ and any constants $a, b, c$, the following is true:
% \[E(aX + bY + c) = aE(X) + bE(Y) + c\]
\end{description}


\label{lotus}
\subsection{LOTUS}
\begin{description}
\item[Expected value of a function of an r.v.]
The expected value of $X$ is defined this way:
\[E(X) = \sum_x xP(X=x) \textnormal{ (for discrete $X$)}\]
\[E(X) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}xf(x)dx  \textnormal{ (for continuous $X$)}\]
The \textbf{Law of the Unconscious Statistician (LOTUS)} states that you can find the expected value of a \emph{function of a random variable}, $g(X)$, in a similar way, by replacing the $x$ in front of the PMF/PDF by $g(x)$ but still working with the PMF/PDF of $X$:
\[E(g(X)) = \sum_x g(x)P(X=x) \textnormal{ (for discrete $X$)}\]
\[E(g(X)) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}g(x)f(x)dx \textnormal{ (for continuous $X$)}\]
\item[What's a function of a random variable?] A function of a random variable is also a random variable. For example, if $X$ is the number of bikes you see in an hour, then $g(X) =  2X$ is the number of bike wheels you see in that hour and $h(X) = {X \choose 2} = \frac{X(X-1)}{2}$ is the number of \emph{pairs} of bikes such that you see both of those bikes in that hour.
\item[What's the point?] You don't need to know the PMF/PDF of $g(X)$ to find its expected value. All you need is the PMF/PDF of $X$. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Universality of Uniform (UoU)} When you plug any CRV into its own CDF, you get a Uniform(0,1) random variable. When you plug a Uniform(0,1) r.v.~into an inverse CDF, you get an r.v.~with that CDF. For example, let's say that a random variable $X$ has CDF
    \[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-x}, \textrm{ for $x>0$} \]
    By  UoU, if we plug $X$ into this function then we get a uniformly distributed random variable.
    \[ F(X) = 1 - e^{-X} \sim \textrm{Unif}(0,1)\]
    Similarly, if $U \sim \textrm{Unif}(0,1)$ then $F^{-1}(U)$ has CDF $F$. The key point is that {for any continuous random variable $X$, we can transform it into a Uniform random variable and back by using its CDF.}

\section{Moments and MGFs}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

\subsection{Moments}

Moments describe the shape of a distribution. Let $X$ have mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, and $Z=(X-\mu)/\sigma$ be the \emph{standardized} version of $X$. The $k$th moment of $X$ is $\mu_k = E(X^k)$ and the $k$th standardized moment of $X$ is $ m_k = E (Z^k)$.
The mean, variance,  skewness, and kurtosis are important summaries of the shape of a distribution.
    \begin{description}
        \item[Mean] $E(X) = \mu_1 $
        \item[Variance] $\var(X) = \mu_2 - \mu_1^2$
        \item[Skewness] $\textrm{Skew}(X) = m_3$
      \item[Kurtosis] $\textrm{Kurt}(X) = m_4 - 3$
    \end{description}

\subsection{Moment Generating Functions}

\begin{description}
    \item[MGF] For any random variable $X$, the function
        \[ M_X(t) = E(e^{tX}) \]
        is the \textbf{moment generating function (MGF)} of $X$, if it exists for all $t$ in some open interval containing $0$. The variable $t$ could just as well have been called $u$ or $v$. It's a bookkeeping device that lets us work with the \emph{function} $M_X$ rather than the \emph{sequence} of moments. 
                
            \item[Why is it called the Moment Generating Function?] Because the $k$th derivative of the moment generating function, evaluated at $0$, is the $k$th moment of $X$.
    \[\mu_k = E(X^k) = M_X^{(k)}(0)\]
    This is true by Taylor expansion of $e^{tX}$ since
    \[M_X(t) = E(e^{tX}) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{E(X^k)t^k}{k!} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\mu_k t^k}{k!} \]

    \item[MGF of linear functions] If we have $Y = aX + b$, then
        \[M_Y(t) = E(e^{t(aX + b)}) =  e^{bt}E(e^{(at)X}) = e^{bt}M_X(at)\]
       
    \item[Uniqueness] \emph{If it exists, the MGF uniquely determines the distribution}. This means that for any two random variables $X$ and $Y$, they are distributed the same (their PMFs/PDFs are equal) if and only if their MGFs are equal. 
    \item[Summing Independent RVs by Multiplying MGFs.] If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then
    \begin{align*}
        M_{X+Y}(t) &= E(e^{t(X + Y)}) = E(e^{tX})E(e^{tY}) = M_X(t) \cdot M_Y(t) 
    \end{align*}
    The MGF of the sum of two random variables is the product of the MGFs of those two random variables.
\end{description}

\section{Joint PDFs and CDFs}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

\subsection{Joint Distributions}
The \textbf{joint CDF} of $X$ and $Y$ is 
$$F(x,y)=P(X \leq x, Y \leq y)$$
In the discrete case, $X$ and $Y$ have a \textbf{joint PMF} 
$$p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X=x,Y=y).$$ In the continuous case, they have a \textbf{joint PDF}
\[f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} F_{X,Y}(x,y).\]
The joint PMF/PDF must be nonnegative and sum/integrate to 1.
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\includegraphics[width=1.0in]{figures/jointPDF.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
\subsection{Conditional Distributions}
\textbf{Conditioning and Bayes' rule for discrete r.v.s}
\[P(Y=y|X=x) = \frac{P(X=x, Y=y)}{P(X=x)} = \frac{P(X=x|Y=y)P(Y=y)}{P(X=x)}\]
\textbf{Conditioning and Bayes' rule for continuous r.v.s}
\[f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{f_{X,Y}(x, y)}{f_X(x)} = \frac{f_{X|Y}(x|y)f_Y(y)}{f_X(x)}\]
\textbf{Hybrid Bayes' rule}
\[f_X(x|A) = \frac{P(A | X = x)f_X(x)}{P(A)}\]

\subsection{Marginal Distributions}
To find the distribution of one (or more) random variables from a joint PMF/PDF, sum/integrate over the unwanted random variables. \medskip

\textbf{Marginal PMF from joint PMF}
\[P(X = x) = \sum_y P(X=x, Y=y)\]
\textbf{Marginal PDF from joint PDF}
\[f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X, Y}(x, y) dy\]


\subsection{Independence of Random Variables}
Random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if any of the following conditions holds:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -1mm
    \item Joint CDF is the product of the marginal CDFs 
    \item Joint PMF/PDF is the product of the marginal PMFs/PDFs
    \item Conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is the marginal distribution of $Y$
\end{itemize}
 Write $X \independent Y$ to denote that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

\subsection{Multivariate LOTUS}
LOTUS in more than one dimension is analogous to the 1D LOTUS.
For discrete random variables:
\[E(g(X, Y)) = \sum_x\sum_yg(x, y)P(X=x, Y=y)\]
For continuous random variables:
\[E(g(X, Y)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x, y)f_{X,Y}(x, y)dxdy\]

\section{Covariance and Transformations}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

\subsection{Covariance and Correlation}
\begin{description}
\item [Covariance] is the analog of variance for two random variables.
    \[\cov(X, Y) = E\left((X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))\right) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)\]
    Note that 
    \[\cov(X, X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 =  \var(X)\]
\item [Correlation] is a standardized version of covariance that is always between $-1$ and $1$.
    \[\corr(X, Y) = \frac{\cov(X, Y)}{\sqrt{\var(X)\var(Y)}} \]
\item [Covariance and Independence] If two random variables are independent, then they are uncorrelated. The converse is not necessarily true (e.g., consider $X \sim \N(0,1)$ and $Y=X^2$).
    \begin{align*}
    	X \independent Y &\longrightarrow \cov(X, Y) = 0 \longrightarrow E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)
    \end{align*}
%, except in the case of Multivariate Normal, where uncorrelated \emph{does} imply independence.
\item [Covariance and Variance]  The variance of a sum can be found by
    \begin{align*}
        %\cov(X, X) &= \var(X) \\
        \var(X + Y) &= \var(X) + \var(Y) + 2\cov(X, Y) \\
        \var(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n ) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\var(X_i) + 2\sum_{i < j} \cov(X_i, X_j)
    \end{align*}
    If $X$ and $Y$ are independent then they have covariance $0$, so
    \[X \independent Y \Longrightarrow \var(X + Y) = \var(X) + \var(Y)\]
    If $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are identically distributed and have the same covariance relationships (often by \textbf{symmetry}), then 
    \[\var(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n ) = n\var(X_1) + 2{n \choose 2}\cov(X_1, X_2)\]
\item [Covariance Properties]  For random variables $W, X, Y, Z$ and constants $a, b$:
    \begin{align*}
    	\cov(X, Y) &= \cov(Y, X) \\
        \cov(X + a, Y + b) &= \cov(X, Y) \\
        \cov(aX, bY) &= ab\cov(X, Y) \\
        \cov(W + X, Y + Z) &= \cov(W, Y) + \cov(W, Z) + \cov(X, Y)\\
        &\quad + \cov(X, Z)
    \end{align*}
\item [Correlation is location-invariant and scale-invariant] For any constants $a,b,c,d$ with $a$ and $c$ nonzero,
    \begin{align*}
        \corr(aX + b, cY + d) &= \corr(X, Y) 
    \end{align*}
\end{description}

\subsection{Transformations}
\begin{description}
    \label{one variable transformations}
    \item[One Variable Transformations] Let's say that we have a random variable $X$ with PDF $f_X(x)$, but we are also interested in some function of $X$. We call this function $Y = g(X)$. Also let $y=g(x)$. If $g$ is differentiable and strictly increasing (or strictly decreasing), then the PDF of $Y$ is
    \[f_Y(y) = f_X(x)\left|\frac{dx}{dy}\right| =  f_X(g^{-1}(y))\left|\frac{d}{dy}g^{-1}(y)\right|\]
    The derivative of the inverse transformation is called the \textbf{Jacobian}.


     \item[Two Variable Transformations] Similarly, let's say we know the joint PDF of $U$ and $V$ but are also interested in the random vector $(X, Y)$ defined by $(X, Y) = g(U, V)$. Let 
       $$  \frac{\partial (u,v)}{\partial (x,y)}  = \begin{pmatrix} 
              \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} &  \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\
           \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}   \\
        \end{pmatrix}$$
     be the \textbf{Jacobian matrix}. If the entries in this matrix exist and are continuous, and the determinant of the matrix is never $0$, then
     \[f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_{U,V}(u,v) \left|\left|   \frac{\partial (u,v)}{\partial (x,y)}\right| \right| \]
   The inner bars tells us to take the matrix's determinant, and the outer bars tell us to take the absolute value.  In a $2 \times 2$ matrix, 
     \[ \left| \left|
     \begin{array}{ccc}
         a & b \\
         c & d
     \end{array}
     \right| \right| = |ad - bc|\]

\end{description}

\label{convolutions}
\subsection{Convolutions}
\begin{description}
    \item[Convolution Integral] If you want to find the PDF of the sum of two independent CRVs $X$ and $Y$, you can do the following integral:
        \[f_{X+Y}(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x)f_Y(t-x)dx\]
    \item[Example] Let $X,Y \sim \N(0,1)$ be i.i.d. Then for each fixed $t$,\[f_{X+Y}(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(t-x)^2/2} dx\]
By completing the square and using the fact that a Normal PDF integrates to $1$, this works out to $f_{X+Y}(t)$ being the $\N(0,2)$ PDF.
\end{description}

\section{Poisson Process}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

\begin{description}
\item[Definition] We have a \textbf{Poisson process} of rate $\lambda$ arrivals per unit time if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The number of arrivals in a time interval of length $t$ is $\Pois(\lambda t)$.
    \item Numbers of arrivals in disjoint time intervals are independent.
\end{enumerate}
For example, the numbers of arrivals in the time intervals $[0,5]$, $(5,12),$ and $[13,23)$ are independent with $\Pois(5\lambda), \Pois(7\lambda), \Pois(10\lambda)$ distributions, respectively.
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/pp.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
       
\item[Count-Time Duality]  Consider a Poisson process of emails arriving in an inbox at rate $\lambda$ emails per hour. Let $T_n$ be the time of arrival of the $n$th email (relative to some starting time $0$) and $N_t$ be the number of emails that arrive in $[0,t]$. Let's find the distribution of $T_1$. The event $T_1 > t$, the event that you have to wait more than $t$ hours to get the first email, is the same as the event $N_t = 0$, which is the event that there are no emails in the first $t$ hours. So
\[P(T_1 > t) = P(N_t = 0) = e^{-\lambda t} \longrightarrow P(T_1 \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}\]
Thus we have $T_1 \sim \Expo(\lambda)$. By the memoryless property and similar reasoning, the interarrival times between emails are i.i.d.~$\Expo(\lambda)$, i.e., the differences $T_n - T_{n-1}$ are i.i.d.~$\Expo(\lambda)$.
\end{description}

\section{Order Statistics}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip
\begin{description}
    \item[Definition] Let's say you have $n$ i.i.d.~r.v.s $X_1, X_2,\dots, X_n$. If you arrange them from smallest to largest, the $i$th element in that list is the $i$th order statistic, denoted $X_{(i)}$. So $X_{(1)}$ is the smallest in the list and $X_{(n)}$ is the largest in the list. \smallskip
    
     Note that the order statistics are \emph{dependent}, e.g., learning $X_{(4)} = 42$ gives us the information that $X_{(1)},X_{(2)},X_{(3)}$ are $\leq 42$ and $X_{(5)},X_{(6)},\dots,X_{(n)}$ are $\geq 42$.
    \item[Distribution]  Taking $n$ i.i.d. random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ with CDF $F(x)$ and PDF $f(x)$, the CDF and PDF of $X_{(i)}$ are:
        \[F_{X_{(i)}}(x) = P (X_{(i)} \leq x) = \sum_{k=i}^n {n \choose k} F(x)^k(1 - F(x))^{n - k}\]
    \[f_{X_{(i)}}(x) = n{n - 1 \choose i - 1}F(x)^{i-1}(1 - F(x))^{n-i}f(x)\]
%    \item[Universality of the Uniform] Let $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ be i.i.d.~CRVs with CDF $F$, and let $U_j=F(X_j)$. By UoU, $U_1,U_2,\dots,U_n$ are i.i.d.~$\Unif(0,1)$. Since $F$ is increasing, $F(X_{(1)}) \leq F(X_{(2)}) \leq \dots \leq F(X_{(n)})$, so $U_{(j)} = F(X_{(j)})$.
    \item[Uniform Order Statistics]  The $j$th order statistic of i.i.d.~$U_1,\dots,U_n \sim \Unif(0,1)$ is $U_{(j)} \sim \Beta(j, n - j + 1)$.
\end{description}


\section{Conditional Expectation}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip
\begin{description}
    \item[Conditioning on an Event] We can find $E(Y|A)$, the expected value of $Y$ given that event $A$ occurred. A very important case is when $A$ is the event $X=x$. Note that $E(Y|A)$ is a \emph{number}. For example: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The expected value of a fair die roll, given that it is prime, is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5 = \frac{10}{3}$.
    \item Let $Y$ be the number of successes in $10$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability $p$ of success. Let $A$ be the event that the first $3$ trials are all successes. Then
    $$E(Y|A) = 3 + 7p$$
    since the number of successes among the last $7$ trials is $\Bin(7,p)$. 
        \item Let $T \sim \Expo(1/10)$ be how long you have to wait until the shuttle comes. Given that you have already waited $t$ minutes, the expected additional waiting time is 10 more minutes, by the memoryless property. That is, $E(T|T>t) = t + 10$.
    \end{itemize}

            \end{tabular}
        }
        \medskip
\begin{description}
    \item[Conditioning on a Random Variable]  We can also find $E(Y|X)$, the expected value of $Y$ given the random variable $X$. This is \emph{a function of the random variable $X$}. It is \emph{not} a number except in certain special cases such as if $X \independent Y$. To find $E(Y|X)$, find $E(Y|X = x)$ and then plug in $X$ for $x$. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If $E(Y|X=x) = x^3+5x$, then $E(Y|X) = X^3 + 5X$.
    \item Let $Y$ be the number of successes in $10$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability $p$ of success and $X$ be the number of successes among the first $3$ trials. Then $E(Y|X)=X+7p$.
    \item Let $X \sim \N(0,1)$ and $Y=X^2$. Then $E(Y|X=x) = x^2$ since if we know $X=x$ then we know $Y=x^2$. And $E(X|Y=y) = 0$ since if we know $Y=y$ then we know $X = \pm \sqrt{y}$, with equal probabilities (by symmetry). So $E(Y|X)=X^2, E(X|Y)=0$.  
    \end{itemize} 
    
        \item[Properties of Conditional Expectation] \quad
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $E(Y|X) = E(Y)$ if $X \independent Y$
        \item $E(h(X)W|X) = h(X)E(W|X)$ (\textbf{taking out what's known}) \\
        In particular, $E(h(X)|X) = h(X)$.
        \item $E(E(Y|X)) = E(Y)$ (\textbf{Adam's Law}, a.k.a.~Law of Total Expectation)
    \end{enumerate}

    \item[Adam's Law (a.k.a.~Law of Total Expectation)]  can also be written in a way that looks analogous to LOTP. For any events $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ that partition the sample space, 
        \begin{align*}
        E(Y) &= E(Y|A_1)P(A_1) + \dots + E(Y|A_n)P(A_n)
    \end{align*}
    For the special case where the partition is $A, A^c$, this says
        \begin{align*}
            E(Y) &= E(Y|A)P(A) + E(Y|A^c)P(A^c)
    \end{align*}

\section{MVN, LLN, CLT}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

\subsection{Law of Large Numbers (LLN)}
Let $X_1, X_2, X_3 \dots$ be i.i.d.~with mean $\mu$. The \textbf{sample mean} is $$\bar{X}_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \dots + X_n}{n}$$ The \textbf{Law of Large Numbers} states that as $n \to \infty$, $\bar{X}_n \to \mu$ with probability $1$. For example, in flips of a coin with probability $p$ of Heads, let $X_j$ be the indicator of the $j$th flip being Heads.  Then LLN says the proportion of Heads converges to $p$ (with probability $1$).

\subsection{Central Limit Theorem (CLT)}
\subsubsection{Approximation using CLT}
We use $\dot{\,\sim\,}$ to denote \emph{is approximately distributed}. We can use the \textbf{Central Limit Theorem} to approximate the distribution of a random variable $Y=X_1+X_2+\dots+X_n$ that is a sum of $n$ i.i.d. random variables $X_i$. Let  $E(Y) = \mu_Y$ and $\var(Y) = \sigma^2_Y$. The CLT says
\[Y \dot{\,\sim\,} \N(\mu_Y, \sigma^2_Y)\]
If the $X_i$ are i.i.d.~with mean $\mu_X$ and variance $\sigma^2_X$, then $\mu_Y = n \mu_X$ and $\sigma^2_Y = n \sigma^2_X$. For the sample mean $\bar{X}_n$, the CLT says
\[ \bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n}(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n) \dot{\,\sim\,} \N(\mu_X, \sigma^2_X/n) \]


\subsubsection{Asymptotic Distributions using CLT}

We use $\xrightarrow{D}$ to denote \emph{converges in distribution to} as $n  \to \infty$. The CLT says that if we standardize the sum $X_1 + \dots + X_n$  then the distribution of the sum converges to $\N(0,1)$ as $n \to \infty$:
\[\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{n}} (X_1 + \dots + X_n - n\mu_X) \xrightarrow{D} \N(0, 1)\]
In other words, the CDF of the left-hand side goes to the standard Normal CDF, $\Phi$. In terms of the sample mean, the CLT says
\[ \frac{\sqrt{n} (\bar{X}_n - \mu_X)}{\sigma_X} \xrightarrow{D} \N(0, 1)\]

\section{Markov Chains}\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

\subsection{Definition}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=2.3in]{figures/chainA.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
A Markov chain is a random walk in a \textbf{state space}, which we will assume is finite, say $\{1, 2, \dots, M\}$. We let $X_t$ denote which element of the state space the walk is visiting at time $t$. The Markov chain is the sequence of random variables tracking where the walk is at all points in time, $X_0, X_1, X_2, \dots$. By definition, a Markov chain must satisfy the \textbf{Markov property}, which says that if you want to predict where the chain will be at a future time, if we know the present state then the entire past history is irrelevant.  \emph{Given the present, the past and future are conditionally independent}. In symbols,
\[P(X_{n+1} = j | X_0 = i_0, X_1 = i_1, \dots, X_n = i) = P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i)\]
\subsection{State Properties}
A state is either recurrent or transient.
\begin{itemize}
\item If you start at a \textbf{recurrent state}, then you will always return back to that state at some point in the future.  \textmusicalnote \emph{You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave.}  \textmusicalnote
\item Otherwise you are at a \textbf{transient state}. There is some positive probability that once you leave you will never return. \textmusicalnote \emph{You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.} \textmusicalnote
\end{itemize}
A state is either periodic or aperiodic.
\begin{itemize}
\item If you start at a \textbf{periodic state} of period $k$, then the GCD of  the possible numbers of steps it would take to return back is  $k>1$.
\item Otherwise you are at an \textbf{aperiodic state}. The GCD of  the possible numbers of steps it would take to return back is 1.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Transition Matrix}
Let the state space be $\{1,2,\dots,M\}$. The transition matrix $Q$ is the $M \times M$ matrix where element $q_{ij}$ is the probability that the chain goes from state $i$ to state $j$ in one step:
\[q_{ij} = P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i)\]

To find the probability that the chain goes from state $i$ to state $j$ in exactly $m$ steps, take the $(i, j)$ element of $Q^m$.
\[q^{(m)}_{ij} = P(X_{n+m} = j | X_n = i)\]
If $X_0$ is distributed according to the row vector PMF $\vec{p}$, i.e., $p_j = P(X_0 = j)$, then the PMF of $X_n$ is $\vec{p}Q^n$.



\subsection{Chain Properties}
A chain is \textbf{irreducible} if you can get from anywhere to anywhere. If a chain (on a finite state space) is irreducible, then all of its states are recurrent. A chain is \textbf{periodic} if any of its states are periodic, and is \textbf{aperiodic} if none of its states are periodic. In an irreducible chain, all states have the same period. \medskip

A chain is \textbf{reversible} with respect to $\vec{s}$ if $s_iq_{ij} = s_jq_{ji}$ for all $i, j$.  Examples of reversible chains include any chain with $q_{ij} = q_{ji}$, with $\vec{s} = (\frac{1}{M}, \frac{1}{M}, \dots, \frac{1}{M})$, and random walk on an undirected network.

\subsection{Stationary Distribution}

Let us say that the vector $\vec{s} = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_M)$ be a PMF  (written as a row vector). We will call $\vec{s}$ the \textbf{stationary distribution} for the chain if $\vec{s}Q = \vec{s}$. As a consequence, if $X_t$ has the stationary distribution, then all future $X_{t+1}, X_{t + 2}, \dots$ also have the stationary distribution. \\

\smallskip

For irreducible, aperiodic chains, the stationary distribution exists, is unique, and $s_i$ is the long-run probability of a chain being at state $i$. The expected number of steps to return to $i$ starting from $i$ is $1/s_i$.

\smallskip

 To find the stationary distribution, you can solve the matrix equation $(Q' - I){\vec{s}\,}'= 0$. The stationary distribution is uniform if the columns of $Q$ sum to 1.

\smallskip

\textbf{Reversibility Condition Implies Stationarity}  If you have a PMF $\vec{s}$ and a Markov chain with transition matrix $Q$, then $s_iq_{ij} = s_jq_{ji}$ for all states $i, j$ implies that $\vec{s}$ is stationary.

\subsection{Random Walk on an Undirected Network}
 \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

        \end{minipage}
\medskip

If you have a collection of \textbf{nodes}, pairs of which can be connected by undirected \textbf{edges}, and a Markov chain is run by going from the current node to a uniformly random node that is connected to it by an edge, then  this is a random walk on an undirected network. The stationary distribution of this chain is proportional to the \textbf{degree sequence} (this is the sequence of degrees, where the degree of a node is how many edges are attached to it). For example, the stationary distribution of random walk on the network shown above is proportional to $(3,3,2,4,2)$, so it's $(\frac{3}{14}, \frac{3}{14}, \frac{3}{14}, \frac{4}{14}, \frac{2}{14})$.

\subsection{Uniform Distribution} Let us say that $U$ is distributed $\Unif(a, b)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Properties of the Uniform] For a Uniform distribution, the probability of a draw from any interval within the support is proportional to the length of the interval. See  \emph{Universality of Uniform} and \emph{Order Statistics} for other properties.
     \item[Example] William throws darts really badly, so his darts are uniform over the whole room because they're equally likely to appear anywhere. William's darts have a Uniform distribution on the surface of the room. The Uniform is the only distribution where the probability of hitting in any specific region is proportional to the length/area/volume of that region, and where the density of occurrence in any one specific spot is constant throughout the whole support.
%     \item[PDF and CDF (top is Unif(0, 1), bottom is Unif(a, b))]

%        1 &  x > b
%      \end{array}
%    \right. 
% \end{eqnarray*}


    
\end{description}

\subsection{Normal Distribution} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Central Limit Theorem] The Normal distribution is ubiquitous because of the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sample mean of i.i.d.~r.v.s will approach a Normal distribution as the sample size grows, regardless of the initial distribution.
    \item[Location-Scale Transformation] Every time we shift a Normal r.v.~(by adding a constant) or rescale a Normal (by multiplying by a constant), we change it to another Normal r.v. For any Normal $X \sim \N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we can transform it to the standard $\N(0, 1)$ by the following transformation:
    \[Z= \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \sim \N(0, 1) \]
%    \item[Example] Heights are normal. Measurement error is normal. By the central limit theorem, the sampling average from a population is also normal.
    \item[Standard Normal] The Standard Normal, $Z \sim \N(0, 1)$, has mean $0$ and variance $1$. Its CDF is denoted by $\Phi$.
\end{description}

\subsection{Exponential Distribution}

Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Expo(\lambda)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] You're sitting on an open meadow right before the break of dawn, wishing that airplanes in the night sky were shooting stars, because you could really use a wish right now. You know that shooting stars come on average every 15 minutes, but a shooting star is  not ``due" to come just because you've waited so long. Your waiting time is memoryless;  the additional time until the next shooting star comes does not depend on how long you've waited already.
    
    \item[Example] The waiting time until the next shooting star is distributed $\Expo(4)$ hours. Here $\lambda=4$ is the \textbf{rate parameter}, since shooting stars arrive at a rate of $1$ per $1/4$ hour on average. The expected time until the next shooting star is $1/\lambda = 1/4$ hour.
    
    \item[Expos as a rescaled Expo(1)]
        \[Y \sim \Expo(\lambda) \rightarrow X = \lambda Y \sim \Expo(1)\]
     
%     \item[PDF and CDF] The PDF and CDF of a Exponential is:
% \[f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, x \in [0, \infty)\]
% \[F(x) = P(X \leq x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}, x \in [0, \infty)\]
    
    \item[Memorylessness] The Exponential Distribution is the only continuous memoryless distribution. The memoryless property says that for $X \sim \Expo(\lambda)$ and any positive numbers $s$ and $t$,
    \[P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t)\]
Equivalently,
    \[X - a | (X > a) \sim \Expo(\lambda)\]
    For example, a product with an $\Expo(\lambda)$ lifetime is always ``as good as new" (it doesn't experience wear and tear). Given that the product has survived $a$ years, the additional time that it will last is still $\Expo(\lambda)$. 

%    Example - If waiting for the bus is distributed exponentially with $\lambda = 6$, no matter how long you've waited so far, the expected additional waiting time until the bus arrives is always $\frac{1}{6}$, or 10 minutes. The distribution of time from now to the arrival is always the same, no matter how long you've waited.

    \item[Min of Expos] If we have independent $X_i \sim \Expo(\lambda_i)$, then $\min(X_1, \dots, X_k) \sim \Expo(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \dots + \lambda_k)$. 
    \item[Max of Expos] If we have i.i.d.~$X_i \sim \Expo(\lambda)$, then $\max(X_1, \dots, X_k)$ has the same distribution as $Y_1+Y_2+\dots+Y_k$, where $Y_j \sim \Expo(j\lambda)$ and the $Y_j$ are independent.     
\end{description}

\subsection{Gamma Distribution}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=1.9in]{figures/gammapdfs.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
\medskip
Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Gam(a, \lambda)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] You sit waiting for shooting stars, where the waiting time for a star is distributed $\Expo(\lambda)$. You want to see $n$ shooting stars before you go home. The total waiting time for the $n$th shooting star is $\Gam(n,\lambda)$.
    \item[Example]  You are at a bank, and there are 3 people ahead of you. The serving time for each person is Exponential with mean $2$ minutes. Only one person at a time can be served. The distribution of your waiting time until it's your turn to be served is $\Gam(3, \frac{1}{2})$.
%     \item[PDF] The PDF of a Gamma is:
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(a)}(\lambda x)^ae^{-\lambda x}\frac{1}{x},
% \hspace{.1 in}
% x \in [0, \infty)
% \end{eqnarray*}

\includegraphics[width=1.9in]{figures/Betapdfs.pdf}
        \end{minipage}
\medskip

\begin{description}

\item[Conjugate Prior of the Binomial] In the Bayesian approach to statistics, parameters are viewed as random variables, to reflect our uncertainty. The \emph{prior} for a parameter is its distribution before observing data. The \emph{posterior}  is the distribution for the parameter after observing data. Beta is the \emph{conjugate} prior of the Binomial because if you have a Beta-distributed prior on $p$ in a Binomial, then the posterior distribution on $p$ given the Binomial data is also Beta-distributed. Consider the following two-level model:
    \begin{align*}
        X|p &\sim \Bin(n, p) \\
        p &\sim \Beta(a, b)
    \end{align*}
Then after observing  $X = x$, we get the posterior distribution
\[p|(X=x) \sim \Beta(a + x, b + n - x) \]

\item[Order statistics of the Uniform] See \emph{Order Statistics}.
\item[Beta-Gamma relationship] If $X \sim \Gam(a, \lambda)$, $Y \sim \Gam(b, \lambda)$, with $X \independent Y$ then
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item $\frac{X}{X + Y} \sim \Beta(a, b)$
    	\item $X + Y \independent \frac{X}{X + Y}$
    \end{itemize}
    This is known as the \textbf{bank--post office result}.
\end{description}


% \[E(X) = \frac{a}{\lambda},  Var(X) = \frac{a}{\lambda^2}\]
% \[X \sim G(a, \lambda),  Y \sim G(b, \lambda),  X \independent Y \rightarrow  X + Y \sim G(a + b, \lambda), \frac{X}{X + Y} \independent X + Y \]
% \[X \sim \Gam(a, \lambda) \rightarrow X = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_a \textnormal{ for $X_i$ i.i.d. $\Expo(\lambda)$} \]
% \[\Gam(1, \lambda) \sim \Expo(\lambda) \]


\subsection{$\chi^2$ (Chi-Square) Distribution}

Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\chi^2_n$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] A Chi-Square($n$) is the sum of the squares of $n$ independent standard Normal r.v.s.
    %\item[Example]  The sum of squared errors are distributed $\chi^2_n$
%     \item[PDF] The PDF of a $\chi^2_1$ is:
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% f(w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi w}}e^{-w/2},
% w \in [0, \infty)
% \end{eqnarray*}
    \item[Properties and Representations]
\[X \textrm{ is distributed as } Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + \dots + Z_n^2 \textrm{ for i.i.d.~$Z_i \sim \N(0,1)$}\]
\[X \sim \Gam(n/2,1/2)\]

\subsection{Bernoulli Distribution} The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest case of the Binomial distribution, where we only have one trial ($n=1$). Let us say that X is distributed \Bern($p$). We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] A trial is performed with probability $p$ of ``success", and $X$ is the indicator of success: $1$ means success, $0$ means failure.
        \item[Example] Let $X$ be the indicator of Heads for a fair coin toss. Then $X \sim \Bern(\frac{1}{2})$. Also, $1-X  \sim \Bern(\frac{1}{2})$ is the indicator of Tails.
        %     \item[PMF.] The probability mass function of a Bernoulli is:
% \[P(X = x) = p^x(1-p)^{1-x}\]
% or simply
% \[P(X = x) = \begin{cases} p, & x = 1 \\ 1-p, & x = 0 \end{cases}\]
\end{description}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
\includegraphics[width=1.3in]{figures/Bin10_05.pdf}
        \end{minipage}

Let us say that $X$ is distributed \Bin($n,p$). We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] $X$ is the number of ``successes" that we will achieve in $n$ independent trials, where each trial is either a success or a failure, each with the same probability $p$ of success. We can also write $X$ as a sum of multiple independent $\Bern(p)$ random variables. Let $X \sim \Bin(n, p)$ and $X_j \sim \Bern(p)$, where all of the Bernoullis are independent. Then
        \[X = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \dots + X_n\]
    \item[Example] If Jeremy Lin makes 10 free throws and each one independently has a $\frac{3}{4}$ chance of getting in, then the number of free throws he makes is distributed  \Bin($10,\frac{3}{4}$).
    %     \item[PMF] The probability mass function of a Binomial is:
% \[P(X = x) = {n  \choose x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\]
\item[Properties] Let $X \sim \Bin(n,p), Y \sim \Bin(m,p)$ with $X \independent Y$.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Redefine success} $n-X \sim \Bin(n,1-p)$
\item \textbf{Sum} $X+Y \sim \Bin(n+m,p)$
\item \textbf{Conditional} $X|(X+Y=r) \sim \HGeom(n,m,r)$
 \item \textbf{Binomial-Poisson Relationship} $\Bin(n, p)$ is approximately  $\Pois(\lambda)$ if $p$ is small.
   \item \textbf{Binomial-Normal Relationship} $\Bin(n, p)$ is approximately $\N(np,np(1-p))$ if $n$ is large and $p$ is not near $0$ or $1$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection{Geometric Distribution} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Geom(p)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] $X$ is the number of ``failures" that we will achieve before we achieve our first success. Our successes have probability $p$.
    \item[Example] If each pokeball we throw has probability  $\frac{1}{10}$ to catch Mew, the number of failed pokeballs will be distributed $\Geom(\frac{1}{10})$.
%     \item[PMF] With $q = 1-p$, the probability mass function of a Geometric is:
% \[P(X = k) = q^kp\]
\end{description}

\subsection{First Success Distribution} Equivalent to the Geometric distribution, except that it includes the first success in the count. This is 1 more than the number of failures. If $X \sim \textnormal{FS}(p)$ then $E(X) = 1/p$.


\subsection{Negative Binomial Distribution} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\NBin(r, p)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] $X$ is the number of ``failures" that we will have before we achieve our $r$th success. Our successes have probability $p$.
    \item[Example] Thundershock has 60\% accuracy and can faint a wild Raticate in 3 hits. The number of misses before Pikachu faints Raticate with Thundershock is distributed $\NBin(3, 0.6)$.
%     \item[PMF] With $q = 1-p$, the probability mass function of a Negative Binomial is:
% \[P(X = n) = {n+r - 1 \choose r -1}p^rq^n\]
\end{description}

\subsection{Hypergeometric Distribution} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Hypergeometric(w, b, n)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] In a population of $w$ desired objects and  $b$ undesired objects, $X$ is the number of ``successes" we will have in a draw of $n$ objects, without replacement. The draw of $n$ objects is assumed to be a \textbf{simple random sample} (all sets of $n$ objects are equally likely).
    \item[Examples] Here are some HGeom examples.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Let's say that we have only $b$ Weedles (failure) and $w$ Pikachus (success) in Viridian Forest. We encounter $n$ Pokemon in the forest, and $X$ is the number of Pikachus in our encounters. 
    \item The number of Aces in a 5 card hand.
    \item You have $w$ white balls and $b$ black balls, and you draw $n$ balls. You will draw $X$ white balls.
    \item You have $w$ white balls and $b$ black balls, and you draw $n$ balls without replacement. The number of white balls in your sample is $\HGeom(w,b,n)$; the number of black balls is $\HGeom(b,w,n)$. 
    \item \textbf{Capture-recapture} A forest has $N$ elk, you capture $n$ of them, tag them, and release them. Then you recapture a new sample of size $m$. How many tagged elk are now in the new sample? $\HGeom(n,N-n,m)$
    \end{itemize} 
%    \item[PMF] The probability mass function of a Hypergeometric:
%\[P(X = k) = \frac{{w \choose k}{b \choose n-k}}{{w + b \choose n}}\]
\end{description}

\subsection{Poisson Distribution} Let us say that $X$ is distributed $\Pois(\lambda)$. We know the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Story] There are rare events (low probability events) that occur many different ways (high possibilities of occurences) at an average rate of $\lambda$ occurrences per unit space or time. The number of events that occur in that unit of space or time is $X$.
    
    \item[Example] A certain busy intersection has an average of 2 accidents per month. Since an accident is a low probability event that can happen many different ways, it is reasonable to model the number of accidents in a month at that intersection as $\Pois(2)$. Then the number of accidents that happen in two months at that intersection is distributed $\Pois(4)$.
    
    \item[Properties]
Let $X \sim \Pois(\lambda_1)$ and $Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_2)$, with $X \independent Y$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sum} $X + Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)$
    \item \textbf{Conditional} $X | (X + Y = n) \sim \Bin\left(n, \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}\right)$
    \item \textbf{Chicken-egg} If there are $Z \sim \Pois(\lambda)$ items and we randomly and independently ``accept" each item with probability $p$, then the number of accepted items $Z_1 \sim \Pois(\lambda p)$, and the number of rejected items $Z_2 \sim \Pois(\lambda (1-p))$, and $Z_1 \independent Z_2$.
\end{enumerate}
    
%     \item[PMF] The PMF of a Poisson is:
% \[P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!}\]
\end{description}


\section{Multivariate Distributions} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip


\subsection{Multinomial Distribution}
    Let us say that the vector $\vec{X} = (X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots, X_k) \sim \textnormal{Mult}_k(n, \vec{p})$  where $\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k)$.
\begin{description}
    \item[Story]  We have $n$ items, which can fall into any one of the $k$ buckets independently with the probabilities $\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k)$.
    \item[Example]  Let us assume that every year, 100 students in the Harry Potter Universe are randomly and independently sorted into one of four houses with equal probability. The number of people in each of the houses is distributed $\Mult_4$(100, $\vec{p}$), where $\vec{p} = (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)$.
        Note that $X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_4 = 100$, and they are dependent.
    \item[Joint PMF]  For $n = n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_k$,
        \[P(\vec{X} = \vec{n}) =  \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_k!}p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\dots p_k^{n_k}\]
    \item[Marginal PMF, Lumping, and Conditionals]
    Marginally, $X_i \sim \Bin(n,p_i)$ since we can define ``success" to mean category $i$. If you lump together multiple categories in a Multinomial, then it is still Multinomial. For example, $X_i + X_j \sim \Bin(n, p_i + p_j)$ for $i \neq j$ since we can define ``success" to mean being in category $i$ or $j$. Similarly, if $k=6$ and we lump categories 1-2 and lump categories 3-5, then
        \[ (X_1+X_2,X_3+X_4+X_5,X_6) \sim \Mult_3(n, (p_1+p_2, p_3 + p_4+p_5,p_6))\]
        Conditioning on some $X_j$ also still gives a Multinomial:
        \[X_1, \dots, X_{k-1} | X_k = n_k \sim \Mult_{k-1}\left(n - n_k, \left(\frac{p_1}{1 - p_k}, \dots, \frac{p_{k-1}}{1 - p_k}\right)\right)\]
    \item[Variances and Covariances]  We have  $X_i \sim \Bin(n, p_i)$ marginally, so $\var(X_i) = np_i(1-p_i)$. Also, $\cov(X_i, X_j) = -np_ip_j$ for $i \neq j$.
    \end{description}
    
\subsection{Multivariate Uniform Distribution}
See the univariate Uniform for stories and examples. For the 2D Uniform on some region, probability is proportional to area. Every point in the support has equal density, of value $\frac{1}{\textnormal{area of region}}$. For the 3D Uniform, probability is proportional to volume.

\subsection{Multivariate Normal (MVN) Distribution}
A  vector $\vec{X} = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k)$ is  Multivariate Normal if every linear combination is Normally distributed, i.e., $t_1X_1 + t_2X_2 + \dots + t_kX_k$ is Normal for any constants $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k$. The parameters of the Multivariate Normal are the \textbf{mean vector} $\vec{\mu} = (\mu_1, \mu_2, \dots, \mu_k)$ and the \textbf{covariance matrix} where the $(i, j)$ entry is $\cov(X_i, X_j)$. 

\begin{description}
\item[Properties] The Multivariate Normal has the following properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item Any subvector is also MVN.
\item If any two elements within an MVN are uncorrelated, then they are independent.
\item The joint PDF of a Bivariate Normal $(X,Y)$ with $\N(0,1)$ marginal distributions and correlation $\rho \in (-1,1)$ is 
$$  f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \tau} \exp{\left(-\frac{1}{2 \tau^2} (x^2+y^2-2 \rho xy)\right)},$$
with $\tau = \sqrt{1-\rho^2}.$

\subsection{Convolutions of Random Variables}
A convolution of $n$ random variables is simply their sum. For the following results, let $X$ and $Y$ be \emph{independent}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  $X \sim \Pois(\lambda_1)$, $Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_2)$ $\longrightarrow X + Y \sim \Pois(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)$
    \item  $X \sim \Bin(n_1, p)$, $Y \sim \Bin(n_2, p)$ $\longrightarrow X + Y \sim \Bin(n_1 + n_2, p)$. $\Bin(n,p)$ can be thought of as a sum of i.i.d.~$\Bern(p)$ r.v.s.

\subsection{Gamma and Beta Integrals}
You can sometimes solve complicated-looking integrals by pattern-matching to a gamma or beta integral:
\[ \int_0^\infty x^{t-1}e^{-x}\, dx = \Gamma(t) \hspace{1 cm} \int_0^1 x^{a - 1}(1-x)^{b-1}\, dx = \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a + b)} \]
Also, $\Gamma(a+1) = a \Gamma(a)$, and $\Gamma(n) = (n - 1)!$ if $n$ is a positive integer.

\begin{description}
\item[Medians and Quantiles] Let $X$ have CDF $F$. Then $X$ has median $m$ if $F(m) \geq 0.5$ and $P(X \geq m) \geq 0.5$. For $X$ continuous, $m$ satisfies $F(m)=1/2$. In general, the $a$th quantile of $X$ is $\min \{x: F(x)\geq a\}$; the median is the case $a=1/2$.

\section{Example Problems} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip
Contributions from Sebastian Chiu

\subsection{Calculating Probability}
A textbook has $n$ typos, which are randomly scattered amongst its $n$ pages, independently. You pick a random page. What is the probability that it has no typos? \textbf{Answer:} There is a $\left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)$ probability that any specific typo isn't on your page, and thus a $\boxed{\left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n}$ probability that there are no typos on your page. For $n$ large, this is approximately $e^{-1} = {1/e}$.

\subsection{Linearity and Indicators (1)} In a group of $n$ people, what is the expected number of distinct birthdays (month and day)? What is the expected number of birthday matches? \textbf{Answer:} Let $X$ be the number of distinct birthdays and $I_j$ be the indicator for the $j$th day being represented. \[E(I_j) = 1-P(\textnormal{no one born on day }j) = 1 - \left(364/365\right)^n\] By linearity, $\boxed{E(X) = 365\left(1-(364/365\right)^n)}$. 
Now let $Y$ be the number of birthday matches and $J_i$ be the indicator that the $i$th pair of people have the same birthday. The probability that any two specific people share a birthday is $1/365$, so $\boxed{E(Y) = \binom{n}{2} / 365}$. 

\subsection{Linearity and Indicators (2)}
\emph{This problem is commonly known as the \textbf{hat-matching problem}}. There are $n$ people at a party, each with hat. At the end of the party, they each leave with a random hat. What is the expected number of people who leave with the right hat? \textbf{Answer:} Each hat has a $1/n$ chance of going to the right person. By linearity, the average number of hats that go to their owners is $\boxed{n(1/n) = 1}$.

\subsection{Linearity and First Success}
\emph{This problem is commonly known as the \textbf{coupon collector problem}}.
There are $n$ coupon types. At each draw, you get a uniformly random coupon type. What is the expected number of coupons needed until you have a complete set? \textbf{Answer:} Let $N$ be the number of coupons needed; we want $E(N)$. Let $N = N_1 + \dots + N_n$, where $N_1$ is the draws to get our first new coupon, $N_2$ is the \emph{additional} draws needed to draw our second new coupon and so on. By the story of the First Success, $N_2 \sim \textnormal{FS}((n-1)/n)$ (after collecting first coupon type, there's $(n-1)/n$ chance you'll get something new). Similarly, $N_3 \sim \textnormal{FS}((n-2)/n)$, and $N_j \sim \textnormal{FS}((n-j+1)/n)$. By linearity,
\[E(N) = E(N_1) + \dots + E(N_n) = \frac{n}{n} + \frac{n}{n-1} + \dots + \frac{n}{1} = \boxed{n\sum^n_{j=1} \frac{1}{j}}\]
This is approximately $n (\log(n) + 0.577)$ by Euler's approximation.

\subsection{Orderings of i.i.d. random variables}
I call 2 UberX's and 3 Lyfts at the same time. If the time it takes for the rides to reach me are i.i.d., what is the probability that all the Lyfts will arrive first? \textbf{Answer:} Since the arrival times of the five cars are i.i.d., all $5!$ orderings of the arrivals are equally likely. There are $3!2!$ orderings that involve the Lyfts arriving first, so the probability that the Lyfts arrive first is $\boxed{\frac{3!2!}{5!} = 1/10}$. Alternatively, there are ${5 \choose 3}$ ways to choose 3 of the 5 slots for the Lyfts to occupy, where each of the choices are equally likely. One of these choices has all 3 of the Lyfts arriving first, so the probability is $\boxed{1 / {5 \choose 3} = 1/10}$.

\subsection{Expectation of Negative Hypergeometric}
What is the expected number of cards that you draw before you pick your first Ace in a shuffled deck (not counting the Ace)?
\textbf{Answer:} Consider a non-Ace. Denote this to be card $j$. Let $I_j$ be the indicator that card $j$ will be drawn before the first Ace. Note that $I_j=1$ says that  $j$ is before all 4 of the Aces in the deck. The probability that this occurs is $1/5$ by symmetry. Let $X$ be the number of cards drawn before the first Ace. Then $X = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_{48}$, where each indicator corresponds to one of the 48 non-Aces. Thus, \[E(X) = E(I_1) + E(I_2) + ... + E(I_{48}) = 48/5 = \boxed{9.6}.\]

\subsection{Minimum and Maximum of RVs}
What is the CDF of the maximum of $n$ independent Unif(0,1) random variables? \textbf{Answer:} Note that for r.v.s $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$, 
\[ P(\min(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) \geq a) = P(X_1 \geq a, X_2 \geq a, \dots, X_n \geq a) \] Similarly, \[ P(\max(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) \leq a) = P(X_1 \leq a, X_2 \leq a, \dots, X_n \leq a) \] We will use this principle to find the CDF of $U_{(n)}$, where $U_{(n)} = \max(U_1, U_2, \dots, U_n)$ and $U_i \sim \Unif(0, 1)$ are i.i.d.
\begin{align*}
P(\max(U_1, U_2, \dots, U_n) \leq a)
&= P(U_1 \leq a, U_2 \leq a, \dots, U_n \leq a) \\
&= P(U_1 \leq a)P(U_2 \leq a)\dots P(U_n \leq a) \\
&= \boxed{a^n}
\end{align*}
for $0<a<1$ (and the CDF is $0$ for $a \leq 0$ and $1$ for $a \geq 1$).

\subsection{Pattern-matching with $e^x$ Taylor series}
For $X \sim \Pois(\lambda)$, find $\displaystyle E\bigg{(}\frac{1}{X+1}\bigg{)}$. \textbf{Answer:} By LOTUS,
\[E\left(\frac{1}{X+1}\right) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k+1} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!} = \frac{e^{-\lambda}}{\lambda}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} = \boxed{\frac{e^{-\lambda}}{\lambda}(e^\lambda-1)}\]

\subsection{Adam's Law and Eve's Law}
William really likes speedsolving Rubik's Cubes. But he's pretty bad at it, so sometimes he fails. On any given day, William will attempt $N \sim \Geom(s)$ Rubik's Cubes. Suppose each time, he has probability $p$ of solving the cube, independently. Let $T$ be the number of Rubik's Cubes he solves during a day. Find the mean and variance of $T$. \textbf{Answer:} Note that $T|N \sim \Bin(N,p)$. So by Adam's Law, \[E(T) = E(E(T|N)) = E(Np) = \boxed{\displaystyle\frac {p (1-s)}{s}}\] Similarly, by Eve's Law, we have that \begin{align*}
    \var(T) &= E(\var(T|N)) + \var(E(T|N)) =  E(Np(1-p)) + \var(Np)\\&= \frac{p(1-p)(1-s)}{s} +  \frac{p^2(1-s)}{s^2} = \boxed{\frac{p(1-s)(p+s(1-p))}{s^2}}
    \end{align*}

%\subsection{MGF -- Distribution Matching}
%(Continuing the Rubik's Cube question above) Find the MGF of $T$. What is the name of this distribution and its parameter(s)? \textbf{Answer:}
%
%    By Adam's Law, we have  \begin{align*} E(e^{tT}) &= E(E(e^{tT}|N)) =E((pe^t + q)^N) = s\sum_{n=0}^\infty(pe^t + 1-p)^n(1-s)^n \\&=\frac{s}{1-(1-s)(pe^t+1-p)} =\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p-(1-s)pe^t}
%    \end{align*}
%    
%    Intuitively, we would expect that $T$ is distributed Geometrically since $T$ is just a filtered version of $N$, which itself is Geometrically distributed. The MGF of $X\sim\Geom(\theta)$ is \[E(e^{tX}) = \displaystyle\frac{\theta}{1-(1-\theta) e^t}\]
%    
%    So, we would want to try to get our MGF into this form to identify what $\theta$ is. Taking our original MGF, it would appear that dividing by $s+(1-s)p$ would allow us to do this. Therefore, we have that \begin{center}
%    $E(e^{tT}) = \displaystyle\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p - (1-s)pe^t} = \frac{\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p}}{1-\frac{(1-s)p}{s+(1-s)p}e^t}$
%    \end{center}
%    
%    By pattern-matching, it thus follows that $\boxed{T \sim \Geom(\theta)}$ where \[\boxed{\theta = \displaystyle\frac{s}{s+(1-s)p}}\]

\subsection{MGF -- Finding Moments}
Find $E(X^3)$ for $X \sim \Expo(\lambda)$ using the MGF of $X$. \textbf{Answer:} The MGF of an $\Expo(\lambda)$ is $M(t) = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda-t}$. To get the third moment, we can take the third derivative of the MGF and evaluate at $t=0$: 
\[\boxed{E(X^3) = \frac{6}{\lambda^3}}\]
But a much nicer way to use the MGF here is via pattern recognition: note that $M(t)$ looks like it came from a geometric series:
\[\frac{1}{1-\frac{t}{\lambda}} = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \left(\frac{t}{\lambda}\right)^n = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{n!}{\lambda^n} \frac{t^n}{n!}\] The coefficient of $\frac{t^n}{n!}$ here is the $n$th moment of $X$, so we have $E(X^n) = \frac{n!}{\lambda^n}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. 

\subsection{Markov chains (1)}
Suppose $X_n$ is a two-state Markov chain with transition matrix \[
Q = \bordermatrix{~ & 0 & 1 \cr
                  0 & 1-\alpha & \alpha \cr
                  1 & \beta & 1-\beta \cr}
\] Find the stationary distribution $\vec{s} = (s_0, s_1)$ of $X_n$ by solving $\vec{s} Q = \vec{s}$, and show that the chain is reversible with respect to $\vec{s}$. \textbf{Answer:} The equation $\vec{s}Q = \vec{s}$ says  that \[s_0 = s_0(1-\alpha) + s_1 \beta \textnormal{ and } s_1 = s_0(\alpha) + s_0(1-\beta)\] By solving this system of linear equations, we have \[\boxed{\vec{s} = \displaystyle\bigg{(}\frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta}, \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\bigg{)}}\] To show that the chain is reversible with respect to $\vec{s}$, we must show $s_i q_{ij} = s_j q_{ji}$ for all $i, j$. This is done if we can show $s_0 q_{01} = s_1 q_{10}$. And indeed, \[s_0  q_{01}  = \frac{\alpha\beta}{\alpha+\beta} = s_1 q_{10}\]

\subsection{Markov chains (2)}
William and Sebastian play a modified game of Settlers of Catan, where every turn they randomly move the robber (which starts on the center tile) to one of the adjacent hexagons.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Is this Markov chain irreducible? Is it aperiodic? \textbf{Answer:} $\boxed{\textnormal{Yes to both.}}$ The Markov chain is irreducible because it can get from anywhere to anywhere else. The Markov chain is  aperiodic because the robber can return back to a square in $2, 3, 4, 5, \dots$ moves, and the GCD of those numbers is $1$.
        \item What is the stationary distribution of this Markov chain? \textbf{Answer:} Since this is a random walk on an undirected graph, the stationary distribution is proportional to the degree sequence. The degree for the corner pieces is 3, the degree for the edge pieces is 4, and the degree for the center pieces is 6. To normalize this degree sequence, we divide by its sum. The sum of the degrees is $6(3) + 6(4) + 7(6) = 84$. Thus the stationary probability of being on a corner is $3/84 = 1/28$, on an edge is $4/84 =  1/21$, and in the center is $6/84 = 1/14$.
    \item What fraction of the time will the robber be in the center tile in this game, in the long run? \textbf{Answer:} By the above, $\boxed{1/14}$.
    \item What is the expected amount of moves it will take for the robber to return to the center tile? \textbf{Answer:} Since this chain is irreducible and aperiodic, to get the expected time to return we can just invert the stationary probability. Thus on average it will take $\boxed{14}$ turns for the robber to return to the center tile.

Contributions from Jessy Hwang, Yuan Jiang, Yuqi Hou
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Getting started.} Start by \emph{defining relevant events and random variables}. (``Let $A$ be the event that I pick the fair coin''; ``Let $X$ be the number of successes.'') Clear notion is important for clear thinking! Then decide what it is that you're supposed to be finding, in terms of your notation (``I want to find $P(X=3|A)$''). Think about what type of object your answer should be (a number? A random variable? A PMF? A PDF?) and what it should be in terms of.

\emph{Try simple and extreme cases}. To make an abstract experiment more concrete, try \emph{drawing a picture} or making up numbers that could have happened. Pattern recognition: does the structure of the problem resemble something we've seen before?
\item \textbf{Calculating probability of an event.} Use counting principles if the naive definition of probability applies. Is the probability of the complement easier to find? Look for symmetries. Look for something to condition on, then apply Bayes' Rule or the Law of Total Probability. 
\item \textbf{Finding the distribution of a random variable.} First make sure you need the full distribution not just the mean (see next item). Check the \emph{support} of the random variable: what values can it take on? Use this to rule out distributions that don't fit.  Is there a \emph{story} for one of the named distributions that fits the problem at hand?  Can you write the random variable as a function of an r.v. with a known distribution, say $Y = g(X)$?
\item \textbf{Calculating expectation.} If it has a named distribution, check out the table of distributions. If it's a function of an r.v. with a named distribution, try LOTUS. If it's a count of something, try breaking it up into indicator r.v.s. If you can condition on something natural, consider using Adam's law. 
\item \textbf{Calculating variance.} Consider independence, named distributions, and LOTUS. If it's a count of something, break it up into a sum of indicator r.v.s. If it's a sum, use properties of covariance. If you can condition on something natural, consider using Eve's Law.
\item \textbf{Calculating $E(X^2)$.}  Do you already know $E(X)$ or $\var(X)$? Recall that $\var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2$. Otherwise try LOTUS.
\item \textbf{Calculating covariance.} Use the properties of covariance. If you're trying to find the covariance between two components of a Multinomial distribution, $X_i, X_j$, then the covariance is $-np_ip_j$ for $i \neq j$.
\item \textbf{Symmetry.} If $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are i.i.d., consider using symmetry.
\item \textbf{Calculating probabilities of orderings.} Remember that all $n!$ ordering of i.i.d.~continuous random variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are equally likely.
\item \textbf{Determining independence.} There are several equivalent definitions. Think about simple and extreme cases to see if you can find a counterexample.
\item \textbf{Do a painful integral.} If your integral looks painful, see if you can write your integral in terms of a known PDF (like Gamma or Beta), and use the fact that PDFs integrate to $1$?
\item \textbf{Before moving on.} Check some simple and extreme cases, check whether the answer seems plausible, check for biohazards.\end{enumerate}


\section{Biohazards} \smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

Contributions from Jessy Hwang

\begin{enumerate} 
\item \textbf{Don't misuse the naive definition of probability.}   When answering ``What is the probability that in a group of 3 people, no two have the same birth month?'', it is \emph{not} correct to treat the people as indistinguishable balls being placed into 12 boxes, since that assumes the list of birth months \{January, January, January\} is just as likely as the list \{January, April, June\}, even though the latter is six times more likely. \\ 
\item \textbf{Don't confuse unconditional, conditional, and joint probabilities.}  In applying $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$, it is \emph{not} correct to say ``$P(B) = 1$ because we know  $B$ happened''; $P(B)$ is the \emph{prior} probability of $B$. Don't confuse $P(A|B)$ with $P(A,B)$. \\
\item \textbf{Don't assume independence without justification.}  In the matching problem, the probability that card 1 is a match and card 2 is a match is not $1/n^2$.  Binomial and Hypergeometric are often confused; the trials are independent in the Binomial story and dependent in the Hypergeometric story. \\
\item \textbf{Don't forget to do sanity checks.} Probabilities must be between $0$ and $1$. Variances must be $\geq 0$. Supports must make sense. PMFs must sum to $1$. PDFs must integrate to $1$. \\
\item \textbf{Don't confuse random variables, numbers, and events.}  Let $X$ be an r.v. Then $g(X)$ is an r.v. for any function $g$. In particular, $X^2$, $|X|$, $F(X)$, and $I_{X>3}$ are r.v.s. $P(X^2 < X | X \geq 0), E(X), \var(X), $ and $g(E(X))$ are numbers. $X = 2$ and $F(X) \geq -1$ are events. It does not make sense to write $\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(X) dx$, because $F(X)$ is a random variable. It does not make sense to write $P(X)$, because $X$ is not an event. \\
\item \textbf{Don't confuse a random variable with its distribution.}  To get the PDF of $X^2$, you can't just square the PDF of $X$. The right way is to use transformations. To get the PDF of $X + Y$, you can't just add the PDF of $X$ and the PDF of $Y$. The right way is to compute the \hyperref[convolutions]{convolution}.
\item \textbf{Don't pull non-linear functions out of expectations.} $E(g(X))$ does not equal $g(E(X))$ in general. The St. Petersburg paradox is an extreme example.  See also Jensen's inequality. The right way to find $E(g(X))$ is with \hyperref[lotus]{LOTUS}.

The table above gives R commands for working with various named distributions.

For example, \texttt{pnorm}, \texttt{qnorm}, and \texttt{rnorm} can be used to get the CDF,  quantiles, and random generation for the Normal.  For the Multinomial, \texttt{dmultinom} can be used for calculating the joint PMF and \texttt{rmultinom} can be used for generating random vectors. For the Multivariate Normal, after installing and loading the \texttt{mvtnorm} package \texttt{dmvnorm} can be used for calculating the joint PDF and \texttt{rmvnorm} can be used for generating random vectors.
